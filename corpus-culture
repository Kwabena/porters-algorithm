Carrie Fisher
For several generations of movie fans, Carrie Fisher has been Princess Leia, the take-charge heroine of Star Wars
 This was a character who was not only a style icon – that cinnamon bun hairdo – but a role model for young girls and inspiration that science fiction could be a genre for women as much as men
 Without Fisher as Leia, we might arguably not have had Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley in the Alien movies or Linda Hamilton’s Sarah Connor in the Terminator films
 We wouldn’t have the most recent Star Wars heroines, Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones)
 And the entire science fiction genre would be so much the poorer
 Fisher also appeared in Shampoo, The Blues Brothers, Hannah and Her Sisters, among many other films and TV shows
 But beyond her acting, Fisher was an accomplished wit, raconteur, and writer
 After she’d put away Leia’s blaster, she worked as a well-paid script doctor in Hollywood, polishing screenplays by punching up the dialogue – she went uncredited on films such as Sister Act, Outbreak, Hook and The Wedding Singer
 Fisher also wrote several books, including Postcards from the Edge, inspired by her relationship with her mother Debbie Reynolds, which went on to be a film starring Meryl Streep
 In her recent memoir The Princess Diarist, she revealed an affair with co-star Harrison Ford on the set of Star Wars in 1976
 She leveraged her wit for a one-woman show called Wishful Drinking, which made fun of her relationship with her mother and her life born into Hollywood royalty
 Fisher died on 27 December, four days after suffering a heart attack

Debbie Reynolds
Carrie Fisher’s mother Debbie Reynolds was one of the last links to the classic studio-system era
 While Fisher appeared in Star Wars at the age of 19, Reynolds was only 19 in 1952 when she appeared in another time-tested masterpiece: Singin’ in the Rain
 Signed to the dream factory studio MGM in the late ‘40s, she had already appeared in Two Weeks With Love and a few other films, but Singin’ in the Rain was a blockbuster
 It was a musical about musicals, a film about film-making, and poked fun at Hollywood with gleeful abandon while cannibalising songs that already had appeared in other musicals for its own soundtrack – setting the stage for Moulin Rouge, Across the Universe, Jersey Boys and other “jukebox musicals”
 Ironic, reflexive, whip-smart, but overwhelmingly joyous, Singin’ in the Rain was a Technicolor explosion of fun, and a high point of the classic Hollywood musical form
 And Reynolds kept performing for another six decades, appearing in the teenybopper flick Tammy and the Bachelor, another beloved musical in The Unsinkable Molly Brown, the epic How the West Was Won, all the way to the TV series Will & Grace, in which she played Debra Messing’s mother, and the Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra as the ivory tickler’s eccentric mother
 Like her daughter, Reynolds was an advocate for mental health awareness, serving as the president of The Thalians, a mental-health awareness organisation long supported by Hollywood
 She died on 28 December, at the age of 84

George Michael
George Michael
In a year that saw the loss of some of the biggest names in popular music, 2016 dealt a late, cruel blow with the death of George Michael, a British pop icon who dominated the charts – and the headlines – through much of the 1980s and ‘90s
 Michael – born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in Finchley, north London – developed an early passion for music and a prodigious song-writing talent (he wrote Careless Whisper at the age of 17), forming the duo Wham
 with his school friend Andrew Ridgeley
 Signed at 18, the pair had a string of early hits, including Wham Rap
, Young Guns (Go For It) and Club Tropicana, before their second album, Make it Big (1984), which included Freedom and Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go along with Careless Whisper, turned them into global stars
 Waving goodbye to Wham
 in 1986, Michael went on to enjoy worldwide solo success with albums such as Faith, Listen without Prejudice Vol 1 and Older, hit duets with Elton John and Aretha Franklin and sold-out stadium tours
 Along with professional success however were crashing lows: in the early ‘90s Michael lost a highly publicised battle with his record company Sony (he accused them of ‘professional slavery’) and suffered debilitating bereavements
 For many years Michael’s sexuality was in question before he was spectacularly ‘outed’, in 1998, by an undercover policeman in an LA public toilet
 He transformed the fiasco into a triumph with the single Outside; its video featured disco-dancing, kissing cops
 Living much of his adult life under the intense glare of the British press, Michael maintained an ambivalent relationship with the tabloids, who relentlessly reported his clashes with the law and issues with drug dependency
 In later years, Michael suffered from creative block, although a new album was reportedly underway, along with a documentary due in 2017
 “I genuinely believe that most of my songs are life-affirming in some way”, he told Kirsty Young on his 2007 Desert Island Discs
 And from the many tributes that flooded social media on Christmas Day, it’s clear that it’s Michael’s often underestimated song-writing genius for which he’ll be remembered
 He died on 25 December, at the age of 53
Zaha Hadid
Zaha Hadid
At the time of her sudden death this year, Zaha Hadid was one of the world’s best-known architects – but for many years she was dismissed as a fantasist dreamer of impossible structures, who couldn’t get anything built
 Today the swooping curves and undulating organic forms that typify her buildings can be seen all over the world, from Guangzhou to Glasgow
 Born in Baghdad, she studied in London and based her practice there
 For many years the studio produced beguiling designs that looked nice on paper and excited other architects, but commissions were few
 This changed with the fire station in the southern German town of Weil am Rhein and a totally distinctive and inventive ski jump in the Austrian Alps
 Large projects followed, including the sort of glamorous, big-ticket commissions that architects covet – concert halls, museums, an opera house – as well as more solidly functional buildings including a BMW factory in Leipzig and a drop-in centre for cancer patients in Scotland
 Hadid also left behind incredible abstract paintings and drawings; in addition to buildings she designed furniture, fashion accessories and even a superyacht
 She died on 31 March, at the age of 56
Prince
Prince
No aspect of Minnesota’s favourite son could be contained: not his output, which Warner Bros Records famously wanted him to slow after he released a new album every 12 months from 1978 to 1992, with only one gap year; not his constant boundary pushing, which saw him embrace virtually every musical genre in his career from disco to jazz to metal; not the length of his songs, which often shattered radio expectations; and not his desire for control, which resulted in him simply playing every instrument himself on his early albums
 In terms of Prince’s facility with production and arranging, his instrument playing and his extraordinary vocal range, he is the greatest talent US pop music has ever seen
 You know you’re dealing with an artist of otherworldly ability when his best-known album – the Purple Rain soundtrack, which essentially resulted in him ‘owning’ a colour – isn’t even among his best dozen or so
 Whatever your mood there’s something from Prince that will fit: whether you’re reflective, depressed, giddy with joy, drunk, or in the mood for love
 He was – and remains, music royalty
 He died on 21 April, at the age of 57
Alan Rickman
Alan Rickman
The much-loved British actor with the languid drawl was found to have the perfect voice in a 2008 study: it was also a voice suited to villainy, as Rickman played some of the most memorable baddies on screen
 From the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves to Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films, Rickman brought a greater complexity to characters than was often in the script
 Starting out as a stage actor, his first film role as Hans Gruber in Die Hard reflected his background in theatre
 Rickman refused to play to Hollywood stereotypes, insisting on wearing a suit instead of dressing like the other terrorists and making a key scene be rewritten
 He commented years later, “It showed that it pays to have a little bit of theatre training
” Rickman balanced villains with leading man parts in films like Truly, Madly, Deeply and the Emma Thompson-scripted Sense and Sensibility
 Thompson remembered “his capacity to fell you with a look or lift you with a word… I couldn’t wait to see what he was going to do with his face next
” He died on 14 January at the age of 69
Harper Lee
Harper Lee
“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view 
 Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it
” The wise words of literary hero Atticus Finch, Harper Lee’s small-town lawyer, ring through To Kill a Mockingbird, which is on one hand a sun-dappled paean to the American South, and the other a gripping and sombre tale of Jim Crow-era race relations seen through the eyes of a child
 The book’s success – published in 1960 when Lee was in her early thirties – was immediate and unprecedented; it went on to sell more than 40 million copies, win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and be transformed, in 1962, into an acclaimed film starring Gregory Peck
 But for its writer, born Nelle Harper Lee in Monroeville, Alabama in 1926, a follow-up remained elusive and she maintained a several-decades-long near-silence, refusing nearly all interview and appearance requests
 In July 2015, a Mockingbird sequel-of-sorts (actually an early draft) was discovered and published as Go Set a Watchman – to some controversy – and Lee again became, for a short while, a publishing sensation
 She died on 19 February – less than a mile from where she grew up – at the age of 89
David Bowie
David Bowie
“I liked… the idea that the Bowie knife was sharpened on both sides so it cuts both ways,” said the iconic singer-songwriter in an interview on his 50th birthday, explaining his choice of stage name
 Born David Robert Jones in Brixton, London, he played with ambiguity throughout his career: from the androgynous space creation Ziggy Stardust and the lightning bolt of Aladdin Sane to the final figure of Lazarus, Bowie continually shed costumes and musical styles, reinventing himself and pop music at the same time
 His forays into acting were just as remarkable, the Goblin King in cult hit Labyrinth both disturbing and alluring in equal parts
 The otherworldly character he inhabited in The Man Who Fell to Earth seemed to linger after the 1976 film – making an appearance on his final album Blackstar, released on his 69th birthday
 As many wrote in tributes at the time of his death, it’s as if the Starman is still waiting in the sky
 He died on 10 January at the age of 69
Pierre Boulez
Pierre Boulez
Perhaps it’s the term ‘classical music’ itself that makes orchestral work synonymous with ‘old’ for so many
 Boulez was the 20th Century’s greatest evangelist of the idea that ‘classical’ can mean ‘new’ and experimental
 He told The New York Times in 1967, "For modern music, I prefer an audience that has vertical interests – that is, people who are interested in modern movies, modern art, modern literature [rather than] those who are interested in Beethoven as they would be in a cup of tea"
 His compositions are to classical what Cecil Taylor’s polarising experiments are to jazz – not for everyone but capable of yielding riches if you open your ears and mind
 Born in France’s Loire region, he studied at the Paris Conservatoire but rejected traditionalism
 A close friend and collaborator of experimental musician John Cage and eventually, Frank Zappa, Boulez’s works like Le Marteau sans maître (The Hammer Without a Master) and Répons, are distinctly unmelodic and percussive
 They spin together in your mind like a web because all the components are connected, as if internet hyperlinks
 In later years Boulez actually did become one of the great trailblazers of digital composition, such as in Dialogue de l’ombre double
 Though he did occasionally conduct popular 19th Century works, Boulez saw the concert hall not as a museum but as a laboratory, with his gaze focused on the future
 He died on 5 January, at the age of 90
Umberto Eco
Umberto Eco
The great Italian writer and public intellectual Umberto Eco saw cultural significance in everything; his writings ranged across topics from medieval aesthetics to the comic strip, Peanuts
 A professor of a branch of literary theory called semiotics, which sees the world as a network of signs filled with hidden meanings to be unlocked, Eco reached public attention in 1980 with his debut novel In the Name of the Rose, which went on to sell more than 10 million copies
 A whodunit of sorts set in the 14th Century, the book made the post-modern theories Eco dealt with in the academy accessible to a wide audience
 Five more novels – including Foucault’s Pendulum and The Island of the Day Before – followed as well as essays on linguistics, anthropology, literary criticism and the workings of the mass media
 A reliably interesting thinker, Eco was never afraid to apply the same intellectual rigour to matters some considered trivial – the best way to eat an in-flight meal, for example, or television game shows – that he brought to his academic and philosophical writings
 He died on 19 February, at the age of 84
Sonia Rykiel
Sonia Rykiel
Named ‘Queen of the Knits’, and in a career spanning five decades, the flame-haired French fashion designer flouted conventions, creating chic but down-to-earth clothes for the modern woman
 There was little in the early history of Rykiel – born Sonia Flis in 1930 – to suggest she would follow a career in fashion
 In 1961, untrained and while pregnant with her first child, she began designing tight-fitting maternity dresses for her husband’s Parisian boutique
 Her most famous creation followed: the ‘poor boy’ sweater, a figure-hugging, striped garment with raised armholes and tight sleeves later worn by Françoise Hardy, Audrey Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot
 She opened her own boutique on the Left Bank in 1968, just as the trend for designer-named prét-à-porter (ready to wear) clothes engulfed Paris
 But fashion wasn’t her only passion – she ran salons in her apartment and wrote books for children and adults
 Throughout her career, she maintained a chic but wearable aesthetic in her designs, along with her signature bright-red coiffure
 Although she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 1996 she told no one, carrying on with her business until handing it over to her daughter Nathalie in 2007
 In 2009 she was appointed a commander of the Légion d’Honneur for services to the French fashion industry
 She died on 25 August, aged 86
Abbas Kiarostami
Abbas Kiarostami
There’s an off-centre quality to the great Iranian master’s films – as if he’s too intellectually rigorous to commit unabashedly to any one point of view with certainty
 Perhaps ‘point of view’ itself is Kiarostami’s greatest theme – explored in films like A Taste of Cherry, where the narrative is undercut by the fourth-wall-breaking presence of Kiarostami’s own film crew in the frame, and Close-Up, which is part documentary, part narrative, part visual essay
 Though a film-maker who worked in Iran for almost 40 years, he wasn’t as interested in getting political as existential
 When you watch a Kiarostami movie you end up asking yourself “How do we find meaning
” And sometimes “Is death the only way out
” But that isn’t to say his films don’t contain politics – Iran’s societal disruptions are always in the background, but as something to be lived rather than polemicised
 Also, even more than Godard and Tarantino, he is the single greatest director of car conversations ever
 He died on 4 July, at the age of 76
Peter Maxwell Davies
Peter Maxwell Davies
The composer Peter Maxwell Davies lived a life of striking and irreconcilable contradictions
 He was a recluse who spurned society for isolation on the island of Orkney, but who rose to be Master of the Queen’s Music, and a staunch modernist whose home for many years had no running water or electricity
 Enormously prolific, his musical output included 10 symphonies, operas, chamber music and – despite the fact that he once told the BBC that “religion is a dirty word” – sacred music as well
 Among his best-remembered works are the musical theatre piece Eight Songs for a Mad King, based on the letters of George III, and the opera Taverner, which was premiered in 1972
 Maxwell Davies’ style varied wildly from piece to piece and often within a single work, combining elements of the European avant-garde, Expressionism, serialism, Renaissance music and Gregorian plainsong
 He died on 14 March, at the age of 81
Gene Wilder
Gene Wilder
In 1996, the actor who defined his screen persona with a role as a hyper-neurotic accountant said that he could no longer tap into that hysteria
 “I’m probably too healthy emotionally
 In those days I was afraid of my own shadow, I was afraid of life
 When my life got straightened out, the parts changed
” Gene Wilder’s Oscar-nominated performance in The Producers (1967), alongside Mel Brook, was followed by a series of shadow-dodging roles that revealed his talent for comic acting
 Born Jerome Silberman in Milwaukee, he honed his skills in childhood, creating skits to cheer up his mother after she suffered a heart attack
 Wilder paired up with Richard Pryor in four films, including Silver Streak (1976) and Stir Crazy (1980), and had stand-out roles playing the straight man, as an alcoholic ex-gunslinger in Blazing Saddles (1974) and as a descendant of the monster-summoning doctor in Young Frankenstein (1974)
 Perhaps his best-known role showcased his genius: he only agreed to play Willy Wonka if he could make his entrance with a cane and a limp, before bouncing into a somersault
 His reason
 “Because from that time on, no one will know if I’m lying or telling the truth
” He died on 29 August, at the age of 83
Leonard Cohen
Leonard Cohen
“I see no disenchantment in Leonard’s lyrics at all,” Bob Dylan told The New Yorker earlier this year
 “There’s always a direct sentiment, as if he’s holding a conversation and telling you something, him doing all the talking, but the listener keeps listening
” Leonard Cohen spurned nicknames like ‘the high priest of pathos’, telling a BBC interviewer: “You get tired, over the years, hearing that you’re the champion of gloom
” During a career spanning more than 50 years, the Canadian poet and singer-songwriter created songs of love and loss, mortality and meditation, his Jewish faith and Buddhist practice infusing his lyrics with a spirituality that was often uplifting
 Many of his works offer a way out of the darkness
 In Anthem, he sings “There is a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in”
 And when describing the much-covered Hallelujah, Cohen said: “It seems to call down some kind of beneficial energy… in the face of the kind of catastrophes that are manifesting everywhere, to say ‘hallelujah’
” He died on 7 November at the age of 82
Peter Shaffer
Peter Shaffer
The multiple Tony and Oscar-winning playwright Peter Levin Shaffer was born in Liverpool in 1926, five minutes after his twin brother, Anthony
 The pair attended Cambridge University, co-editing the college’s Granta magazine before writing a series of detective novels together under the name ‘Peter Anthony’
 Peter first gained recognition with his play Five Finger Exercise in 1958, but it was for London’s National Theatre, established in 1963, that Shaffer’s best-known work came to life, including The Royal Hunt of the Sun, about the Spanish conquest of Peru, and Black Comedy, a farce set during a blackout
 A pair of equal but warring central characters was a common occurrence in Shaffer’s writing, including the hit Equus (1973), about a disturbed teenager and his psychiatrist, of which the playwright commented “If it was a success in Britain it was because it was about horses, and if it was a success in America it was because it was about psychiatrists
” In 1979, Amadeus made its debut at the National Theatre, starring Paul Scofield as the court composer Salieri, who is fiercely jealous of child prodigy and his rival, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Simon Callow)
 A film adaptation starring F Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce went on to win eight Academy Awards, including one for Shaffer’s adapted screenplay
 Were Shaffer’s plays’ fixation with duality and competition due to a fierce sibling rivalry
 journalists often wondered (Anthony also became a successful playwright)
 Perhaps in part, but great drama, as Shaffer himself put it, “is made out of the conflicts between opposing states of mind”
 He died on 6 June, at the age of 90
Jacques Rivette
Jacques Rivette
The most devoted cineastes will say that the French New Wave master whose works have aged the best is not Godard, Truffaut, Varda or Rohmer, but Rivette
 Perhaps it’s because Rivette’s films, with their intimidating durations, censorship battles, fluid narratives borne of improvisation, and a mix of humour with startling observations on aesthetics, are simply more ‘challenging’ than those of his peers and conducive to obsession
 Celine and Julie Go Boating, a three-hour tour de force, is constructed largely as an exercise in watching the two title characters watch a movie within the movie, while Out 1 remains largely unseen owing to its 12-hour-plus runtime
 Like Godard and Truffaut, he worked as a film critic for Cahiers du Cinema – many consider him the finest writer of the critics-turned-New Wave directors – and he shared their adoration of Nicholas Ray, Howard Hawks and Hollywood genre film-making
 Of all the New Wave film-makers he feels like the one who, even when addressing the most serious of ideas, took himself the least seriously
 He died on 29 January, at the age of 87
Edward Albee
Edward Albee
Edward Albee was a towering figure in American theatre, whose caustic, mercilessly funny plays took the absurdities of modern living in their sights
 His 1962 play Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf
, a blistering portrait of a toxic marriage, put him on the map; in 1967 he returned to lampoon the institution in A Delicate Balance, another work that delves into the unspoken anxieties of the middle class
 In 1975 he won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama with Seascape – again a play about couples in crisis – but after that his career went into serious decline
 Beginning with Three Tall Women in 1994, Albee saw a reversal in his fortunes and his later years saw the rapturous reception of The Goat, or Who is Sylvia
 – in which a man falls in love with a goat – and his final work, Me, Myself and I, about the dysfunctional relationship between a woman and her two sons, who she is unable to tell apart
 He died on 16 September, at the age of 88
George Martin
George Martin
A trained musician, George Martin worked in the BBC’s classical department before moving to EMI and its subsidiary, Parlophone, producing jazz and classical as well as comedy records for Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Peter Ustinov
 He was behind a wave of hit British acts in the 1960s, including Gerry and the Pacemakers and Cilla Black, but it was his work with four other Liverpudlians that understandably overshadowed them all
 “If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George,” Paul McCartney wrote in tribute to Martin, who from 1962 to 1970 produced 13 albums and 22 singles for the group
 His influence on The Beatles’ output is undeniable: he added strings to songs such as Yesterday, encouraged the band to experiment with electronic sounds and harnessed recording techniques from his comedy days to play with backwards vocals and instrumentation
 Martin was among a small group – Phil Spector and Quincy Jones included – who revolutionised what a record producer could do, and an evidently inspirational figure for later generations
 Among the many tributes left on Twitter, producer Mark Ronson wrote: “We will never stop living in the world you helped create
” Martin died on 8 March at the age of 90
There’s a treat in store for anyone who takes a perverse pleasure in seeing truly terrible films, because Hollywood’s latest video-game adaptation, Assassin’s Creed, is a Christmas turkey with all the trimmings
 That may not seem too surprising, given that most films based on video games are awful, but this one isn’t a shoddy cash-in, as so many of them are
 Earnest, unorthodox, and clearly expensive, Assassin’s Creed has the special dreadfulness of a project conceived as a towering artistic masterpiece
    Imagine a remake of The Matrix scripted by a five-year-old boy and edited by a chimpanzee 
Its director is the acclaimed Justin Kurzel, whose feverish Macbeth was in competition at Cannes in 2015
 Its two A-list stars are Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, who were in Macbeth together
 And it is plain that they are all taking the ludicrous material very, very seriously
 Fassbender and Cotillard are both as scowly and intense as they were in Shakespeare’s tragedy, and Kurzel has fashioned all sorts of moodily lit, inventively psychedelic sci-fi weirdness
 And yet, despite their considerable efforts, everyone involved must have realised, by the end of production, that Assassin’s Creed had fallen several miles short of the film they had in mind
 Imagine, instead, a remake of The Matrix directed by Terry Gilliam, but scripted by a five-year-old boy and edited by a chimpanzee
Kurzel’s folly gets off to an ominously indecisive start by having three separate beginnings
 The first of these is set in Spain in 1492 (guess which Italian navigator pops up), where Fassbender’s character, Aguilar, is being inducted into a secret society of hooded assassins called, imaginatively, the Assassins
 A central part of the induction ritual is to have one of your fingers lopped off so that it won’t get in the way of a spring-loaded knife strapped to your wrist
 It’s the kind of idiotic concept that would be forgivable in a video game, or in a knowingly trashy action movie, but which is embarrassing in something as portentous as Assassin’s Creed
The story begins – again – in 1986 by showing a boy named Cal Lynch practising BMX stunts, the film’s one and only attempt to humanise its main character
 It then begins a third time in 2016 with Cal, now played by Fassbender, in a Texan prison, about to be executed for murder
 But don’t be put off
 Cal grunts that his victim was a “pimp”, so it’s supposedly acceptable to view Cal as a hero
The lethal injection doesn’t work, unfortunately, and Cal wakes up in a Bond villain’s lair, ie, a cavernous paramilitary compound with concrete walls at funny angles, and an absurd number of security guards wandering around in smart uniforms
 Unlike most Bond villain’s lairs, though, this one isn’t hidden in a volcano, but perched on a mountain overlooking Madrid
 What do the locals think of it, I wonder
 Have they heard that it houses “a private organisation dedicated to the perfection of humankind”
 Or are they just glad that it provides so many employment opportunities for aspiring security guards
The organisation’s top scientist, Sofia Rikkin (Cotillard), is the person who rescued Cal from death row, but don’t ask me how she did it
 She saved him, she explains, so that he can locate The Apple of Eden, which isn’t really an apple, but an ancient metal orb containing “the genetic code for free will”
 If that sounds ridiculous, listen to this: the Apple has been missing since 1492, which means that the characters in the 21st Century must believe that the characters in the 15th Century knew all about DNA
 How do you like them apples
Next level
Sofia then explains that Cal is descended from the Assassin we met at the start of the film
 Despite being distant relatives, their genetic make-up is apparently so similar that once Cal is strapped into Sofia’s virtual-reality past-life-regression machine, the Animus, he will be able to experience everything his ancestor did, and that will somehow lead Sofia and her colleagues to the Apple
 The upshot of this convoluted premise is that the film gets to be stupid, tedious and incoherent in two different time periods
 In the present-day segments, Cal hangs around the compound, listening to the gobbledigook intoned by Sofia and her dad (Jeremy Irons, topping up his pension fund)
 In the Robin Hood-like segments set in the past, Aguilar battles the Knights Templar, using lots of martial arts and parkour techniques which you wouldn’t normally associate with Renaissance Spain
    The problem is that we aren’t offered any grounds whatsoever to care what happens 
These acrobatics might have been fun to watch if they weren’t obscured by clouds of smoke and shredded by the frantic editing, but I have my doubts
 The problem is that we aren’t offered any grounds whatsoever to care what happens
 We learn almost nothing about Cal and Aguilar, or about Sofia’s organisation, or about her father, or about the other people in the compound, or about what the Apple actually does, or about the Assassins, or about why they’re all so relaxed about having their fingers chopped off
Even when an intriguing idea does crop up, the film doesn’t make anything of it
 For instance, the Christian reconquistadores are portrayed as fanatical villains while the Muslim Moors are the good guys, which is certainly unconventional for a Hollywood blockbuster
 There’s also a speech about the Assassins being the defenders of “protest and dissent”, a notion which might, in theory, have had some contemporary relevance
 But don’t expect Assassin’s Creed to say anything boldly political
 As po-faced as it is, it devotes more dialogue to the food served in the compound’s canteen than it does to the state of the world
Presumably Kurzel was hoping to explore some more of the game’s themes in a sequel, because the film he’s made doesn’t even have a proper ending
 Just when it seems as if the plot might at last be getting underway, it cops out with an abrupt anti-climax, and a final shot which could have been captioned: “To Be Continued
” The chances of a sequel happening, however, are very slim indeed

In the mid-1960s the BBC was concerned
 Pirate radio stations and the commercial broadcaster Radio Luxembourg were drawing in huge audiences of young British music fans, hungry for new and exciting musical sounds
 It was clear that ‘Aunty Beeb’ was losing the nation’s youth, and that something must be done

Until then, the BBC’s radio output was a relatively pastoral landscape of programming that included The Archers, The Goon Show, Hancock’s Half Hour, and Friday Night is Music Night
 The quality was high - plenty of these programmes were groundbreaking and still stand up as classics today
 On the flip side, the offering of BBC music shows that British teenagers found engaging was mainly limited to The Saturday Club
 This early pop programme was presented by Brian Matthews, produced by a young and ambitious Bernie Andrews and had been a stalwart of the airwaves since 1957
From 1945, the BBC’s Light Programme was the corporation’s main output of light entertainment and music
 It was on this station where the BBC’s new lively, modern music show would land (late at night, mind you) and kick off a chain of pop and rock sessions that have now gone down in recorded music history
What’s in a name
The name Top Gear, chosen by a competition winner, referenced the slang word ‘gear’ for fashionable Carnaby Street clothing and the Beatles’ popular expression ‘fab gear’
 Contrived as it may sound now, the name was a statement of intent from the BBC, which wanted to connect with the trendy fans of the underground British music scene

The first episode, presented by Brian Matthew and produced by Bernie Andrews, got off to an impressive start with live sessions from Dusty Springfield and The Beatles
 The format mixed recordings and live guests and lasted for two hours
 This first incarnation of Top Gear only lasted a year and was axed in 1965
Fast forward two years and Top Gear had been revived with presenters John Peel, Tommy Vance and Pete Drummond at the helm
 Meanwhile, the BBC had decided to create a new radio station for their younger audience – Radio 1 – in a direct response to the ultra-popular pirate stations
 It was on BBC Radio 1 where Top Gear had found its more suitable home

Peel, with his relaxed and personable presenting style, may have seemed like an unusual choice for an upbeat pop show
 But in the long-run, it was exactly what the programme needed and it wasn’t long before John Peel became the sole presenter
 Top Gear was changing into a progressive music show and Peel’s deep love for, and knowledge of, a broad range of music resulted in a wide roster of acts appearing, right through into the 1970s
Nature and nurture
A year after its revival, John Peel, along with producers Bernie Andrews and John Walters, had turned Top Gear in to an award-winning and highly respected programme
 Acts who played influential sessions for Top Gear during its lifetime included Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, The Who, Free, Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Manfred Mann, The Rolling Stones and The Kinks
 Many of these acts made the big time after their performances on the programme, making their Top Gear sessions even more important
 Whether their success was a direct result of their appearance on Top Gear or other means, it proved that Top Gear was on to something good
Andrews’ dedication to giving newer acts decent studio time meant that Top Gear also helped nurture some of pop music’s brightest stars
 One of those performers was a young David Bowie
 During Bowie’s stuttering start to life as a mainstream act, he performed a number of times on Top Gear
 “We kept Bowie alive for a couple of years,” said John Peel on Radio 1’s Radio Radio programme in 1986
 “He went through a bad patch of not getting very much work and people not paying a great deal of attention to him
 He did a lot of sessions [for Top Gear] during that time
”
In 1975, faced with financial strife, the BBC decided to call time on Top Gear as part of a wider cutback to Radio 1’s schedule
 The programme may have dropped out of fashion by that time, but John Peel continued to be a massively influential figure in British popular music and broadcasting
 His Peel Sessions took the baton from Top Gear and the programme continued on Radio 1 for 37 years until Peel’s death in 2004

Like John Peel, Top Gear will be remembered for its pioneering nature – giving so many bands that much needed space to blossom and to be heard
 It handed them time and let their talents shine
As for the name ‘Top Gear’, well… whatever happened to that
The new architectural year begins with the opening of Hamburg’s long-awaited and dauntingly ambitious €798 million (£669 million) Elbphilharmonie, an operatic concert hall complex designed by the Swiss studio Herzog & de Meuron
Here in the city’s old docks, now transformed into a new quarter of Hamburg – all smart restaurants, hotels and apartment blocks – the eye-catching Elbphilharmonie appears to ride on the crest of a solid brick bunker like some vast and diaphanous glass wave breaking over bedrock
The bunker is in fact a muscular 1960s warehouse designed by the distinguished post-war architect Werner Kallmorgen
 Built to store tea, coffee and cocoa, as did its pre-war predecessors dating back centuries, it now serves as a car park and ancillary spaces for the glass-faced concert hall
    The Elbphilharmonie is an inspired meeting between Hamburg’s past, present and future 
A long and curving escalator glides up from Kallmorgen’s warehouse to a stirring framed view of the city centre
 A second, shorter escalator takes concertgoers up into the imaginative embrace of swirling foyers and dramatic concert halls and to a viewing gallery wrapped around this landmark building
A tour-de-force, the Elbphilharmonie is also an inspired meeting between Hamburg’s past, present and future
 For all the brio of its design, this is architecture as diplomacy
 In the course of 2017, as the very future of Europe is debated, architecture will be under scrutiny in increasingly political terms
Reconstructing history
In Gdańsk, Poland, a striking museum of World War Two due to open in January is the subject of bitter political controversy
 Commissioned in 2008, from Studio Architektoniczne Kwadrat, the museum is meant to tell the story of the impact of the 1939-45 war on ordinary people, both civilians and soldiers, and whether Polish or not
With Professor Norman Davies, an expert in Polish history, as chairman of the advisory board, the museum’s remit has been explored assiduously and its collections garnered from across Europe and the United States
 Now, though, says Poland’s right-wing Law and Justice government, its programme is wrong
 It should focus exclusively on Poland’s role in the war and it may be necessary to join it to a second, and yet to be commissioned, new museum devoted to the Battle of Westerplatte, when, in September 1939, Germany invaded Poland through Gdańsk
So, here, nationalism may yet triumph over the spirit of internationalism that defeated Hitler
 Rather heartbreakingly, the deconstructed forms of the museum’s architecture with its tilting central tower might now be seen as a representation of the fragmentation of Europe not so much in the 1930s, but in the 21st Century
    A plan to rebuild the tower of the Garrison church has been condemned by those who believe the spirit of Adolf Hitler still haunts this once sacred site 
Meanwhile, political controversy rages in Potsdam, too
 Here, a seemingly innocent plan to rebuild the 290-ft (88m) Baroque tower of the 1730s Garrison church – commissioned by Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia from his court architect Phillip Gerlach – to mark the 500th anniversary of the birth of Protestantism in October 2017, has been condemned by those who believe the spirit of Adolf Hitler still haunts this once sacred site
While a sizable number of historic buildings damaged or destroyed during WWII have been recreated in Germany in recent years, none has been as controversial as this Potsdam church ravaged by fire in the aftermath of an RAF bombing raid in April 1945
 For, this is where Hitler – born a Catholic, but no friend of Christianity – was sworn in as Chancellor by the 85-year old German president, Field Marshall Paul von Hindenburg, a Prussian aristocrat dressed that day in full military regalia
Inside and outside Potsdam’s Garrison church, then, was that fateful union between Nazism and the spirit of Prussian militarism
 Three days later, the Reichstag passed Hitler’s Enabling Act and, with it, sealed the newly dictatorial state’s savage fate
 The church itself survived as a ruin until demolished by order of the German Democratic Republic in 1968 after which a bland computing centre was built in its place
Antipathy to the reconstruction project is, perhaps, understandable even though overtly military symbols – carved stone swords, drums and pistols – have been omitted from the new work and a promise has been made that if the nave of the church is rebuilt the result will be a wholly modern design
Reach for the stars
In Santander, north-west Spain, the Genoese architect Renzo Piano – an Italian senator and natural diplomat – has faced controversy of a different sort over the design of the Botín Centre, a cultural complex funded by the foundation established by the owners of Banco Santander, due to open next year
Designed in the guise of a pair of stylised, ultra-modern and milky-white glazed hulls raised on stilts, the Bótin Centre has aimed to bypass political and cultural controversy by landing as lightly as possible on the site of a former car park facing the city’s sweeping bay
Piano has done pretty much everything he can to preserve and frame views of the sea from the city, to keep the building no higher than the trees of the Jardines de Pereda and to diffuse its lightweight structure and gently curving forms with light refracted from a skin comprising 360,000 off-white circular ceramic tiles
And, yet, as Antonio Gonzalez-Capitel, a professor in the architecture department of Madrid’s Polytechnic University, has told the press, “You shouldn’t build out over the Cantabrian Sea – that’s been architectural common sense for the last 3,000 years
 Santander is a beautiful provincial city and this man [Emilio Botín] who made his bank the biggest in the country is now planting his steel boot in the place where he was born
”
Even the 2017 Expo – latest successor to the 1851 Great Exhibition held in London – lacks the innocence of its predecessors and their innovative architecture
 The 2017 event is to be held in Astana, capital of Kazakhstan, the economically successful former Soviet socialist republic dominated since independence in 1991 by the authoritarian former Communist Party leader Nursultan Nazarbayev
How many foreigners will make the trip to Astana between June and September next year
 It is hard to say, yet there will be those curious to see the 30 swirling futuristic buildings designed here, along the theme ‘Future Energy’, by the Chicago architects Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill
 Smith was the architect of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, currently the world’s tallest building, while he and Gill are working on the much taller, one-kilometre high Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia, due for completion in 2020
Each new year heralds the latest rash of tall buildings, each vying to be higher, more attention grabbing and more clown-like than its rivals
 And this is why a very particular skyscraper to be opened in Orlando, Florida will, perhaps, set a different and less controversial architectural tone for 2017
 The ‘polercoaster’ skyscraper, designed by Bill Kitchen’s US Thrill Rides, is a glistering observation tower down the outside of which whooping and screaming theme-park goers will loop, dive and spiral down to the ground
The skyscraper promises “high thrills developed in a small diameter footprint”, and so might be considered an ideal prototype for developers, clients and cities looking to build the wackiest skyscrapers in pricey city plots
Discounting the fake movie that provided Argo with its title, no science fiction film has ever won the Oscar for best picture
 Arrival is the perfect film to redress this
 Not only is Denis Villeneuve’s thoughtful sci-fi puzzle politically relevant in the age of Trump, its first-contact premise provides a framework for spectacular visuals, intelligent storytelling and a profoundly moving performance from Amy Adams as a linguistics expert brought in to communicate with the film’s tentacle-clad alien visitors
 As they trigger complex thoughts about the shape of her character's life with her terminally ill daughter, Adams grounds the film emotionally, enabling it to pull off a subtly dazzling twist that rewires the entire narrative
 Oscar-winning films have a tendency to look to the past
 Arrival looks to the past, the present and the future and views it all as one
 It’s a giant storytelling leap worthy of recognition

Moonlight
(Credit: A24)
The concept of Moonlight, using three actors to portray the protagonist at three stages of youth, sounds stagey: it was adapted from the play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue by Tarell Alvin McCraney
 But Barry Jenkins' film about a sensitive boy growing up in the drug-soaked Miami of the 1980s is cinematically expressive and emotionally real
 With ragged camera work reflecting Chiron’s often-troubled perspective, Jenkins builds a heartfelt yet notably ambivalent coming-of-age and coming-out story that has tough things to say about the construction of African-American masculinity
 Manchester by the Sea is also affecting; La La Land is also clever, but Moonlight can match any of the other nominees in a crowded best picture category for the clarity of Jenkins’ vision and the delicacy of the performances by Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes

Manchester by the Sea

This is one of the most wonderfully written pictures I have ever seen – or heard

 This amazing cinematic text gives birth to a fully constituted movie
 Kenneth Lonergan is a playwright and a screenwriter, but in three movies he has become a one-of-a-kind director, who engages his actors and actresses to elicit from them frighteningly truthful performances and set them in a perfectly defined milieu
 This constant attention to detail is the tool that allows Lonergan to get at the core of the mysteries he's exploring: why we love; why we hurt the ones we love; and how can we live with pain, our own and others'
 Manchester by the Sea is a sombre movie that paradoxically illuminates the lives of those who see it
 Let's hope the Academy members are photosensitive

La La Land
(Credit: Lionsgate)
So far, La La Land has been the front runner for best picture at the Oscars, and for good reason: Damien Chazelle’s candy-coloured musical – which harks back not only to the great MGM song-and-dance films of the 1950s, but the pensive, pastel-hued meditations of Jacques Demy – reinvigorates a beloved Hollywood genre with bravura brush strokes
 But La La Land also plays as a love letter to a medium that Chazelle clearly sees as threatened
 Ryan Gosling’s character, a jazz musician with tetchy purity standards for the music he loves, could just as easily have been a film-maker who perceives such advances as digital filmmaking and home-entertainment centres with ambivalence, if not outright grief
 Technically and thematically, La La Land checks just about every box for Academy members who no doubt admire Chazelle’s energy and prowess, and share his passion for cinema as an art form, emotional conduit and imperiled cultural practice

Hacksaw Ridge
(Credit: Lionsgate)
You may not like Mel Gibson so much anymore but after seeing Hacksaw Ridge, the film that has brought him back into Hollywood acceptance, you simply cannot deny his gifts as a film-maker
 There's a brutal directness to his storytelling that other directors shy from
 This real story of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who served heroically as a medic in the hell of Okinawa, is a classic war movie up there with Saving Private Ryan
 By choosing this subject, a man who would not touch a weapon, Gibson has adroitly turned his own penchant for violence, so often condemned, into one of the strengths of the movie, enabling it to stand aside from the very thing it shows
 The film convincingly shows us that there can be heroes in real life as well as in cartoon universes – and Gibson gets a better performance out of Andrew Garfield here than Scorsese did in Silence
 So it's not progressive
  Hacksaw Ridge is ultimately a faith film and what it believes in is courage

Fences
(Credit: Paramount Pictures)
Denzel Washington’s adaptation of August Wilson’s Fences lifts the Pulitzer Prize-winning play from the stage whole, yet manages to avoid the pitfalls that often befall stage-to-screen adaptations
 Instead of opening up the play with new scenes, director Washington and his cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen open up the frame around the actors, positioning them in ways that make the mountains of dialogue they utter as visually cinematic as possible
 This focus on the actors as they powerfully deliver Wilson’s words and emotions is a lost art, reminding the viewer of works by Sidney Lumet and Billy Wilder
 Fences makes universal its stinging glimpse of the hardships of 1950’s working class African-Americans
 Wilson’s message is superbly rendered by the career-best performances of Washington and Viola Davis
 Though I’d seen the play, this film haunted me more than any fictional 2016 film I saw

Hidden Figures
(Credit: 20th Century Fox)
The best movies show us our shared connections
 They remind us of our humanity
 They tell stories that move us
 While not many movies are able to accomplish this feat, Hidden Figures absolutely does
  The film tells the story of three African-American women who are experts in Stem (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths)
 We see so few women on screen working in these fields, and even fewer who are African American
 And the fact that this is a true story, yet one most are unfamiliar with, is disgraceful
 We’ve been deprived this amazing story about women of colour for too long
 But the movie doesn't dwell on the fact that history has ignored these women’s invaluable contributions
 Through Hidden Figures’ emotions, wonderful acting and joy we become a part of the story and are taken on a ride with these women that culminates in one of the greatest feats of humanity: a person going into space
 What Hidden Figures teaches us is that man made it to space thanks to the calculations of an incredibly brilliant African-American woman
 With its box office success, Hidden Figures has proven that audiences are hungry for these types of stories, and just like The Right Stuff, it will be a movie about the struggle to get to space that will endure for future generations

Hell or High Water
(Credit: CBS Films)
'Muscular film-making' is one of those movie criticism clichés that gets spat out as often as 'Rollercoaster thrillride' and ''Fun for the whole family
' but Hell Or High Water really is just that
 Muscular film-making, that is, not 'Fun for the whole family
' Weighty and thrilling, featuring impactful performances from an Oscar veteran (Jeff Bridges) and Oscar inevitables (Chris Pine and Ben Foster), it tells a worthwhile story of cops and robbers, age and youth, reverse mortgages and, um, angry armed posses
 Writer Taylor Sheridan – who also gave us Sicario – brings us real characters with true depth, and British director David McKenzie (Starred Up, Young Adam) executes every scene in this modern Western thriller with such confidence that you’ll swear he was born and raised in Texas himself
 Beautiful, complex and exceptionally rewatchable, this is eminently Oscar-worthy and, well, muscular film-making

Lion
(Credit: The Weinstein Company)
Unequivocally deserving of the Oscar for best picture, Lion is beautiful, brilliant, and easily one of the most important films of 2016
 Inspiring and unbelievable as it might be, what makes Saroo Brierley’s story so powerful is that it’s also universal
 One needn’t be a young boy lost in India to know the fear of separation, or an adopted child a continent from home to yearn for a connection to his or her roots
 Therein lies Lion’s potency – it is inherently relatable to every man, woman, and child the world over
 At a point when global dynamics (especially those regarding foreigners) are shifting at a dramatic pace, for a film to eschew borders and embrace such elemental human truths as home and love is profoundly necessary
 Timeliness alone, however, does not make a film the best of its year
 Expert craftsmanship, gorgeous cinematography, and stellar acting all must contribute
 In Lion, they do, and the result is a genuine, poignant, and urgent film nonpareil
 Zach Hollwedel, staff writer, Under the Radar
Call me a stickler, but I always think that if a sequel has “Darker” in its title, then it should be, well, less light than the film it’s following
 Gloomier, maybe
 Murkier, if you like
 Perhaps a bit more tenebrious and crepuscular
 But the makers of Fifty Shades Darker obviously disagree
 The sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey, again adapted from a bestselling ‘erotic’ ‘novel’ by EL James, is brighter, cheerier, more colourful, and altogether fluffier than its predecessor
 It’s also better
 But only slightly
The last film came to an abrupt ending of the coitus interruptus variety
 A student with a long fringe and the unlikely name of Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) was being whipped by her brooding billionaire boyfriend, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), when she decided that his taste for S&M was too extreme for her
 She walked out on him, disgusted by his savagery
 It seemed as if there was little hope that they could save their relationship
    It would be over in half that time if it weren’t for the regular-as-clockwork sex scenes 
And yet – spoiler alert – they save it in no time
 At the start of Fifty Shades Darker, Ana is at the opening of her friend’s photography show in Seattle (creepily, this so-called friend didn’t tell her that several of those photographs would be poster-sized close-ups of her) when Christian walks in and promises her that from now on he won’t do anything in or out of the bedroom that upsets her
 He is keen on whips and chains because he had a rough childhood, he explains, but now he is willing to put all that behind him
 Ana agrees to give him another chance
 And that’s it
 That’s the whole film
Despite drifting along for almost two hours, 50 Shades Darker is about nothing except Christian being nice and Ana being pleased about it
 It would be over in half that time if it weren’t for the regular-as-clockwork sex scenes and some of the most distractingly blatant product placement ever seen outside of a Bond movie
And don’t get too excited about those sex scenes
 Johnson and Dornan sportingly get their tops off on a regular basis, but the reformed Christian doesn’t persuade Ana to do anything that would be too outré for a romantic comedy
 The posters show the lovers wearing masks, which might suggest some sort of illicit swingers’ club, as in Eyes Wide Shut
 But no – it turns out that Christian’s parents are throwing a Venetian-themed charity ball
 What’s ‘Darker’ about that
Bound to fail 
To be fair, there are a few speed bumps on the course of true love
 One of Christian’s exes (Bella Heathcote) keeps popping up and looking glum
 The woman who taught Christian everything he knows about bondage appears, too, although because she is played by Kim Basinger, she makes you wish you were watching 9 1/2 Weeks instead
 Ana also has some difficulties at her groovy new office job (thus making you wish you were watching Johnson’s mother, Melanie Griffith, in Working Girl)
 And Christian’s helicopter crashes for no reason whatsoever
 But it’s hilarious how quickly and easily these little snags are smoothed over and forgotten
 It may be a thrill to have a boyfriend so wealthy, well-connected, skilled and decisive that he can make every problem vanish instantly, but it doesn’t do much for dramatic tension
    There are times when the film’s comedy is deliberate, rather than accidental 
Still, the fact that Fifty Shades Darker is actually Fifty Shades Lighter than the first film is a point in its favour
 One of the only redeeming features of Fifty Shades of Grey was that Johnson was well aware of how daft it was, and managed to undercut its pomposity with an array of eye rolls, pouts, and ironicly delivered lines
 It’s hard to say whether that film’s director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, saw the funny side, but her replacement on the sequel, James Foley, is happy to indulge his leading lady’s impish sense of humour
 Ana is a stronger heroine as a result, and there are times when the film’s comedy is deliberate, rather than accidental
It still isn’t great, mind you
 With its wispy plot, its flat dialogue, its rudimentary staging, and its drooling adoration of the super-rich’s conspicuous consumption, Foley’s dopey romantic fantasy is only a few semi-nude scenes away from being a daytime-TV movie
 But the added levity does make a welcome change
 It seems as if everyone involved in the production realised that because Fifty Shades of Grey was dreadful, but made £450 million at the box office, anyway, they might as well relax and enjoy themselves
The trouble is that if you take away Christian’s tortured soul and his air of mystery, you’re left with a fundamentally boring person
 Is there any chance that Ana will stick with this humourless dweeb after she’s got tired of being handcuffed and blindfolded
 Towards the end of the film, someone accuses her of being a gold-digger, and I was struck by what an ingenious twist that would be
 What if the trilogy’s next instalment revealed that Ana was a cunning confidence trickster who only put up with Christian’s kinks because she wanted his money
 It would be a lot more interesting than anything that happens in Fifty Shades Darker
Under battered Yorkshire skies, with grime beneath its nails and soil clodding up the treads of its boots, Francis Lee's outstanding feature debut God's Own Country is a work of rough-hewn alchemy
 But instead of gold, from the muck and straw it spins a thrillingly real story of gay love
 It will inevitably invite comparisons with Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain — at times it almost actively courts them — but seldom has a film or its characters felt less derivative
In any case, this isn't only a love story
 It is also an immigrant tale and an unflinching portrait of rural farm life where the war between tradition and change is bitter and has real casualties
 And in Josh O'Connor (Peaky Blinders) the film finds a central performance of such authenticity and naturalism that is feels like it grew there, planted some years ago, with a root system that extends for miles under these forbiddingly lovely moors
    The film’s sense of place recalls Andrea Arnold’s viscerally damp and windswept Wuthering Heights 
This sense of place, and of tactile immediacy in the detail and dirt of its wild location, at times recalls Andrea Arnold's viscerally damp and windswept take on Wuthering Heights, but there is nothing ethereal about Lee's vision of rural life
 Instead he finds beauty in details of skin, fur, ordure, spit, vomit, semen, mucus and afterbirth
 Here the ‘miracle of birth’ and the ‘circle of life’ are captured in shots of chickens pecking at eggshells, ewes licking the mucus from their newborns, or, during one exceptional sequence, a dead lamb being briskly skinned and its hide used to clothe a runt, so that it will be accepted by the bereaved mother
In fact the first animal birth that happens here is an abortive one: Johnny (O'Connor) is away bringing a cow to market, and having an anonymous, illicit sexual encounter with a young man he meets there, while back on the farm the pregnant cow to whom he had been tending, dies in the process of giving birth to a half-dead calf
 His father Martin (Ian Hart) whose failing health necessitates the use of two walking sticks, unambiguously blames his son and leaves the mercy killing of the calf to him
‘Animalistically sexual’
Surly, scowling Johnny lives on the inexorably failing livestock farm with his father and grandmother (a terrific Gemma Jones) in an atmophere of mutual hostility and barked-out orders reluctantly followed
 Martin, all but incapacitated, hires a Romanian migrant worker to help out for a week during lambing season and when Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu) arrives, it seems at first like he will be just another reason for resentment
 Johnny, who gets so blind drunk in the pub most nights that his mornings are spent vomiting, is openly hostile to him, as well as sneeringly dismissive of his old friends from the region who have gone away to college
 The only hint we get that there was ever anything more to Johnny than this unprepossessing truculence is at the pub, when an old acquaintance urges him to join her and her college mate for a drink: "He's really funny
 You know, like you used to be
"
For his part, Gheorghe takes uncomplainingly to the privations of this isolated location, sleeping in a chilly caravan in the courtyard and passing the days working with Johnny mostly in silence
 But he is good at the tasks required of him, not just the fence-mending and wall-repairing but the real business of lambing
 And during a few days spent away from the farmhouse, in the hills looking after the sheep, living on off-brand pot noodles and sleeping next to each other in a ramshackle outbuilding, Johnny and Gheorghe's relationship becomes first animalistically sexual (their first roll in the hay is notable for the lack of hay: they rut in the dirt) and then, astonishingly to Johnny, loving
 Under the influence of sudden happiness, manifested in night-time trysts and secret smiles (though perhaps not so secret to Nan's sharp eyes) Johnny's imperceptible ugly duckling transformation is a quiet joy to behold
    Maybe it’s time to let gay love stories be gay love stories, to apologise for their themes as little as God’s Own Country does 
In the past, when faced with ‘gay films’ of the calibre of Moonlight, Carol, the upcoming Sundance wonder Call Me By Your Name or, now, God’s Own Country – films that tell their stories with tenderness and insight and without a scintilla of camp – the tendency in reviewing has been to somehow claim them ‘for everyone who has ever loved’ or ‘for cinema’, in such a way that defines ‘cinema’ as a broadly heterosexual endeavour, and denies their essential queerness
 There is a place for that project – there is sociological importance, not to mention a financial imperative, in presenting gay stories in a way that universalises that experience for a wider (read: predominantly heterosexual) audience
 But it can't help but feel like maybe the time for that fastidiousness is past
 Maybe it's time to let gay love stories be gay love stories, to apologise for their themes as little as God’s Own Country does
Unlike so many films in this category, this is not about coming out, at least not in the traditional sense — Johnny’s sexuality is a pre-established fact, however unspoken it may be in that household
 If anything, it portrays a painfully, magnificently real character coming out as worthy of love, like it's a gift he didn't know he wanted and could never have believed he deserved
 It’s not despite Johnny’s gayness, but because of it that the journey is so captivating
BBC Culture is partnering with Magnum Photos for their second annual photography awards
 As the competition opens, we’ve picked previous winning images that reframe the world
BBC Culture is partnering with Magnum Photos, the international photographer’s co-operative, for its annual awards, which open today
 Any photographer – professional or amateur – interested in entering can apply here: the competition closes on 16 May, and winners will be announced on 18 July
 The competition will once more be hosted through LensCulture, and this year’s jury includes Magnum photographers David Hurn, Susan Meiselas and Alec Soth, as well as National Geographic Magazine’s director of photography Sarah Leen
We’ll be sharing outstanding submissions on Facebook throughout the competition – to see them, like our page if you don’t already
 Once it’s over, we will publish a series of features on selected winners
 In addition, all the winners, finalists and jurors’ picks will be digitally exhibited at the Photographers’ Gallery in London
 To celebrate the launch of the competition, we’ve picked images from winners and finalists last year
 Warning: some of the images may cause distress
Liquid Mountains of Lake Erie by Dave Sandford 
Dave Sandford has christened the waves he’s captured on camera with imposing names such as The Punisher, The Sandstorm and Bane of the Great Lakes
 This one is called Lake of the Cat: Sandford shot his images on Lake Erie in Ontario, which takes its name from a native tribal word erige (cat) because of its unpredictable nature
 “When the violent wind storms of Lake Erie whip up, the lake becomes like a giant washing machine,” says Sandford
 “There is no pattern, like the swell from ocean waves
 These waves move in almost any and every direction
”
The Canadian photographer – a finalist in the 2016 Magnum Awards – visited the lake throughout the autumn months, sometimes for eight hours a day, sustaining wind speeds of up to 65 mph (100 km/h)
 Wave heights reached 25 feet (7
6m)
 “It is on days like these that most people stay away from the lake
 But it is days like these when Erie comes alive, showing its true power
 These are the days I can’t wait to get to the lake and create my images
”
His images have also helped others who work on the lake to connect with it in a new way
 “I have had a number of people contact me about my work, including ship captains of 40 years, fishermen who spent their career on the lakes, and those who grew up on the shores
 All of them tell me the same thing: they thank me for capturing the raw, violent power that the lake displays
”
Otsuchi Future Memories by Alejandro Chaskielberg
Another project – chosen by Magnum Photos president Martin Parr in the jurors’ picks category – reveals the power of waves in a haunting way
 Imbued with watery tints, as though they themselves have been washed away, the photos of Alejandro Chaskielberg show inhabitants of Otsuchi Town, Iwate Prefecture a year and a half after the massive tsunami of 2011 hit Japan
They huddle in family groups of multiple generations or teams of co-workers (including the Second Squad of the Otsuchi Volunteer Fire Department), in the places where they lived or worked before they were destroyed
 Other images show waterlogged family albums or single snaps marbled by the sea
 In this photo, four members of the same family – Takuji Sasaki, Miyoko Abe, Hitoshi Abe and Nichirou Abe – sit in the ruins of their house that was flooded and then consumed by fire
Nilin by Cris Toala Olivares
Cris Toala Olivares was born in Ecuador and trained in medicine in the Netherlands, but changed profession after feeling that bureaucratic red tape got in the way of offering proper patient care
 Since then, he has photographed volcanoes worldwide as well as an intertidal zone on the Dutch, German and Danish coasts
 He was a documentary single image winner in the Magnum Awards for something more human: a photo showing Israeli soldiers shooting tear gas during a demonstration against Israel’s separation barrier in the West Bank village of Nilin
There Are No Homosexuals in Iran by Laurence Rasti
Swiss photographer Laurence Rasti quotes Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – speaking at Columbia University in 2007 – in the text accompanying her images
 “In Iran, we do not have homosexuals like in your country,” said the former Iranian President
 In Iran, homosexuality is still punishable by death
 “Their only legal options are to leave the country, hide their sexuality, or choose transsexuality, a practice tolerated by law but also considered pathological,” says Rasti
She photographed gay Iranian couples in the small town of Denizli in Turkey
 “Hundreds of Iranian gay refugees have put their lives on pause while waiting to join a host country where they can freely live their sexualities,” she says, feeling that anonymity was the best protection but offering it in often surprising ways through her photographs
 Some are hidden behind veils; others partially obscured by roses
 She claims that the series “tries to give back to these people a face that their country has temporarily stolen”
Daesh by Asger Ladefoged
Danish photojournalist Asger Ladefoged has covered the terror attacks and the refugee crisis in Europe, as well as conflict in Syria, Iraq and Ukraine
 This photo – which was a single image winner in the open category – shows Ahmad, a young man in his early twenties
 According to Ladefoged, he is a member of Isis: “In February 2015, Kurdish YPG militia arrested him after he was seen and revealed in their territory in the northeastern part of Syria
”
Palm Wine Collector, Kunene Region, Namibia by Kyle Weeks
This photo – a single image winner in the fine art category – shows a Himba man who has selected, prepared and maintains a Makalani palm during the sap-tapping process
 According to Namibian photographer Kyle Weeks, “the Himba people from this area have utilised this plant family for generations, passing down the knowledge and technique needed to carry out the process of obtaining the liquid”
The tradition runs against recent environmental protection efforts
 “Although the Makalani palm is a protected tree in Namibia and the tapping of palms a banned practice, the Ovahimba firmly believe that it is their right to continue,” says Weeks
 “They argue against Western law, instead following ancient cultural traditions that respect these palms in their utilisation and in turn promote their conservation on a cultural level
”
At the Last Second by Valery Melnikov
The Russian photographer Valery Melnikov was a World Press Photo winner before becoming a photojournalism single image winner in the 2016 Magnum Awards for this photo
 He has covered the Chechen war, the conflict between Georgia and South Ossetia, and the Syrian civil war, and began documenting the war in Eastern Ukraine in 2014
He took this photo on 2 July 2014, just as two civilians escaped from a fire at a house destroyed by an air attack in Donbass, eastern Ukraine
 His current ongoing project, Black Days of Ukraine, is about “ordinary civil people who became the participants of the military confrontation against their will”, and he aims to record “the political and social life of societies in conflict”
Refugees by Mauricio Lima
Brazilian photographer Mauricio Lima found a way to personalise what is considered the biggest human exodus since the end of World War Two, winning the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography
 In 2015, he followed the Majid family, after they had left Syria, for 29 days as they travelled through seven countries − from Serbia to Sweden
 The resulting project was the documentary series winner in the Magnum Awards, its photos offering glimpses of the realities at each step of the journey
In one, adults and children are piled on top of each other as they sleep on a bus floor; another shows Iranian refugees sitting on a rail track in protest after only asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria were allowed to cross the Greek border into Macedonia
 This image captures the struggle as refugees barred from crossing the border try to grab donations of water, blankets and nappies after ten days encamped next to a train station in Idomeni, Greece
Fire of Hatred by Asghar Khamseh
A finalist in the Magnum Awards, Iranian photographer Asghar Khamseh has created a series of heartbreaking portraits showing the victims of acid attacks
 Often taking place in family conflicts – whether rejected marriage proposals, divorce requests or prompted by envy – they aim to create “cultural destitution and intolerance”, according to Khamseh
 “In addition to physical and psychological damage, the victims face the experiences of social stigma and blame
”
In this image, Raana Mehri holds a photo of herself and her mother Somayeh
 When Somayeh requested a divorce, her husband threw acid on her face and body as well as on Raana
 They were disfigured and both lost their right eyes
 Somayeh survived for four years, suffering through numerous operations
 In April 2015, due to side effects from the attack, including lung scarring, she died in a Tehran hospital
One of the images that originally appeared in this story has since been removed due to uncertainty over the age of one of its subjects
Could the painting possibly be a paean, even in its mildly ironic way, to small-town America, to those simple, decent values ascribed to the US heartland
 Or is it, as so often assumed, a straightforward satire
 Is its intention to hold up to ridicule the small-minded provincialism of the American Midwest, and its hostility to outsiders
Grant Wood’s American Gothic is a painting that’s puzzled generations who’ve stopped to wonder at the real meaning behind it
 We all know it: a close-cropped portrait of a grim-faced Iowan couple in front of their scrupulously neat, gothic-arched, timber house – in a style also called Carpenter’s Gothic for its homespun take on Victorian Gothic architecture, and for which the painting is named
American Gothic
American Gothic will be on show at the Royal Academy in London in February – the first time the painting has travelled outside of North America (Credit: Alamy)
It was painted in 1930, when US artists were inspired to paint realist scenes of rural America during the Depression, rejecting European modernist influences for a decidedly home-grown, often folksy authenticity, in a style that became known as Regionalism
 This February, the painting will travel outside of North America for the first time, as the centrepiece of the Royal Academy in London’s exhibition America After the Fall: Painting in the 1930s, where it will be shown alongside both Regionalist and modernist works
The striking couple are identified either as a homesteading farmer and his wife, or as a daughter with her taciturn and over-protective father
 Wood’s sister, Nan, who posed for the picture, always insisted the two were father and daughter, perhaps finding the age gap too unseemly
 The relationship has always remained interestingly ambivalent
    The scene isn’t in any sense ‘real’ – everything about it is an artful set-up 
Unlike her elder companion’s fixed stare, the woman doesn’t meet our gaze, but, slightly squint-eyed under that furrowed-brow, glances off to the side
 Her expression is actually difficult to determine
 She looks sorrowful, or perhaps fretful, or perhaps stoic, or even perhaps simply sour-faced, though her straitlaced Puritan primness is subtly undermined by an escaping coil of hair at the nape of her neck
 As if holding guard against those anticipated intruders – as likely as not, protecting his daughter-wife’s virtue, though she doesn’t seem particularly happy about it – the man grips a pitchfork in a warrior-like fashion
 And it’s this devilish motif that lends the work its ambivalent, uneasy comedy
 Without it, the mood of American Gothic would certainly feel a little more plaintive, and a little less like the theatrical tableau it is, for the scene isn’t in any sense ‘real’
 Everything about it is an artful set-up
Not amused
First of all, Nan never actually posed with the man in the picture, nor are they in any way related
 Wood had spotted the house during a drive to the town of Eldon in Iowa
 It immediately gave him an idea
 “That idea was to find two people who, by their severely straight-laced characters, would fit into such a home,” he later explained
 So the impetus for the painting is a story-telling one, and a resolutely anti-modernist one
Grant Wood

Wood came to paint the picture in his late thirties, having, in his twenties, spent some time studying painting in Paris, the centre of avant-garde art, and in Munich
 Having become familiar with modern painting, he himself had painted in an Impressionist manner, but on his return to the Midwest he was soon to reject all he had seen and learned
 He would adopt the detailed, realist style of 15th-Century Flemish painter Van Eyck, and he would embrace Regionalism, but with his own character-driven twist
 Despite going back to earlier European traditions, Wood really felt that what he and the Regionalists were doing was finally liberating American art from cultural colonialism, which is something only the later Abstract Expressionists, who embraced modernism full-tilt, would be championed for doing
 American Gothic has become an American icon, but Regionalism itself would never be thought of as a significant movement in the canon of US art history
Wood must have learnt all about plein-air painting in Paris, but the couple in American Gothic were painted separately, and neither sitter was painted in front of the house
 The farmer, as you might have already guessed, isn’t actually a farmer, but a certain Dr Bryon McKeeby, a well-to-do dentist from Cedar Rapids, where Wood lived with his mother and sister
 The couple’s clothing too has been carefully handpicked by the artist, and the woman’s dress is distinctly old-fashioned, so the first viewers of the painting would have quickly noted the air of nostalgia – though, with the painting’s hard lines and surfaces, there’s little accompanying sentimentality
    There is satire in it, but only as there is satire in any realistic statement – Grant Wood 
In addition, both their faces, Nan’s in particular, have been thinned and elongated, as has the prominent gothic window and roof
 And, if you look carefully, you might even detect something funereal about the scene, beyond the tombstone features of the couple
 It’s subtly suggested by the woman’s primly buttoned black dress, which she wears under her rickrack-trimmed apron, in the man’s smart black overcoat, which contrasts with his overalls, and by the drawn blinds of the window below the arched one
 Why are they closed on such a bright day

Regarding the painting’s comic tone, Wood himself gave contradictory accounts
 “There is satire in it,” he once said, “but only as there is satire in any realistic statement
” Perhaps it is this ambiguity that has made the painting endure as the most iconic, and of course the most parodied, in US history
 Gertrude Stein, insisted that the painting was a “devastating satire
” The modernist writer and avid collector of Picasso and Matisse even went as far as to describe Wood, apparently without a hint of irony herself, as the “foremost American painter
” Others despised it for its ‘fake-folkery’
 Clement Greenberg, the towering art critic who championed Jackson Pollock, also chipped in and opined that Wood is “among the notable vulgarisers of our period
”
Odd couple
As with the Louvre’s Mona Lisa, which has also had its share of cartoon iconoclasts, American Gothic is a star attraction at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it’s been since winning a bronze medal and $300 in a painting competition the year it was painted
 But its inclusion in the collection wasn’t immediately welcome
 An official at the museum snortingly described it as “a comic Valentine”
A parody of American Gothic

With the advent of mass media the two characters have taken on a life of their own, appearing in everything from TV commercials for cornflakes and several US sitcoms, to a cameo appearance as a pair of creepy puritans in The Rocky Horror Picture Show
 And there’s hardly a president and his first lady whose heads haven’t been transposed onto the pair
 Most recently, in the UK’s Spectator magazine, Donald and Melania looked impassively out as the house and barn behind them burned
One of the most powerful riffs on the painting doesn’t have any comic undertow, however
 Instead, Gordon Parks’ 1942 photograph of Ella Watson, a black office cleaner, makes searingly visible the previously invisible
Ella Watson by George Parks
Gordon Parks’ 1942 photograph of Ella Watson riffs on American Gothic for a serious rather than comic effect (Credit: Getty Images)
Watson, who stands on her own, is framed by a huge broom, which she holds, and a mop, to the side, in place of the male figure, which now takes on a ghostly absence
 The backdrop isn’t a house but the US flag
 (Watson’s job was to scrub the floors of a federal government building in Washington DC – she is at work)
 Wearing round-rimmed spectacles, her painfully thin, androgynous figure appears to stand in for both characters in Wood’s painting
 Subverting the whiteness of that enduring painting, Parks’ photograph, which later appeared on the cover of the Washington Post, is an astonishingly poignant image
 (Incidentally, Parks himself would later become a pioneering director of the first Blaxploitation films and in 1984 made the first film adaptation of 12 Years a Slave
)
It is the slipperiness of American Gothic that makes it continue to resonate so powerfully
 The painting is simply ambiguous enough to speak to each generation on their own terms
The artist Sidney Nolan painted desert adventurers and shipwrecked travellers, but in the end, it was an Australian outlaw who catapulted him to fame
 Nolan’s celebrated Ned Kelly cycle of 27 paintings – a series completed with extraordinary swiftness between 1946 and 1947 – features Kelly’s violent showdown with police
 But Kelly, who was arrested and executed in 1880, aged 25, was also the artist’s most enduring subject
 Nolan returned to him throughout his life, perhaps recognising something of the bushranger’s rebel spirit in his own
Today, both artist and outlaw appear to be the most quintessential of Australian figures
 But many of Nolan’s subjects spring from the experiences of British and Irish settlers in the 19th Century; Kelly was the son of an Irish convict who’d been transported as a young man from Tipperary to Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania) for stealing two pigs
 Nolan himself had Irish heritage – and spent the last 40 years of his life living in the UK
 These connections to Britain are being explored in a series of events and exhibitions celebrating Nolan’s life and work this year, the centenary of the artist’s birth

When Nolan moved to the UK in 1951, he was championed enthusiastically by influential figures in the British art world
 One significant figure was Kenneth Clark, former director of the National Gallery in London and later the writer and presenter of the BBC’s groundbreaking series Civilisation
 Having first seen Nolan’s work while in Australia in 1949, Clark had encouraged the artist to move to London
 He became an eager patron and purchased several paintings by Nolan, among the most important being the mysterious Convict in a Billabong –based on the story of an infamous kidnapping of a white woman by a native Aborigine and her rescue by an white Australian convict – and the eerily empty, cratered landscape of Central Australia
In his 1950 painting Central Australia, Nolan depicted his homeland as eerie, almost alien (Credit: Sidney Nolan Trust)
Part of Nolan’s magnetism was his ability to evocatively reinvent many of Australia’s colonial folkloric figures
 His profoundly disquieting series of paintings featuring two ill-fated desert adventurers, Burke and Wills, is particularly strange and haunting
 These paintings speak eloquently of the tragic hubris of the white settler to this inhospitable continent
 Ill-equipped and ill-prepared, Robert O’Hara Burke and William John Wills hatched a foolhardy plan to hike cross-country across Australia’s desert planes (from Melbourne in the south to the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north, a distance of some 2,000 miles)
 Lacking the deep knowledge of the land possessed by indigenous people, they, along with most of their crew, perished on their return
The 1960 work Convict in a Billabong
The 1960 work Convict in a Billabong tells a story of shipwreck and betrayal (Credit: Sidney Nolan Trust)
    In Nolan, Kenneth Clark found an artist pursuing the enlightened and humanist tradition in art 
Nolan’s Mrs Fraser paintings, of which Convict in a Billabong was one, tell a similarly devastating story
 In the 1860s, Eliza Fraser and her husband were shipwrecked on an island off the coast of Queensland
 After her husband was murdered by Aborigines, Mrs Fraser lived among them
 She was eventually rescued by an escaped convict, David Bracefell, who became her lover and whom Mrs Fraser eventually betrayed to the authorities, whereupon he received a death sentence
 These themes may have spoken to Nolan deeply
 Before he left Melbourne, Nolan had lived with his art patrons John and Sunday Reed, conducting an open relationship with Sunday
 He was bitterly hurt when she eventually rejected him after refusing to leave her husband
The 1977 painting Peter Grime’s Apprentice
Based on an 1810 poem and later opera, the 1977 painting Peter Grime’s Apprentice depicts a fisherman who kills his apprentices (Credit: Tate London/Sidney Nolan Trust)
Nolan’s work may have been resolutely figurative, mythic and narrative-based, but it still retained a sense of modernism firmly wedded to the 20th Century
 Yet his paintings opposed the trajectory of much modernist painting of the postwar period – particularly American painting, in which abstract art was dominant
 What Clark saw in Nolan’s work was an escape from what he perceived to be the sterile dead-end of formalist abstract painting
 There were always the figurative paintings of Francis Bacon, of course, but Clark found Bacon’s vision far too bleak, far too cruel, its preoccupation with human suffering offering little in the way of moral or spiritual uplift
 In Nolan, Clark found instead an artist pursuing the enlightened and humanist tradition in art
English embrace
Even so, Nolan would soon became familiar with – and influenced by – Bacon’s work
 His 1957 painting of Ned Kelly’s death mask in the hauntingly beautiful painting The Death of the Poet was inspired by Bacon’s existential depictions of William Blake’s death mask painted two years earlier (though it also drew inspiration from Nolan’s love of the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, hence its title)
    Nolan would soon became familiar with – and influenced by – Francis Bacon’s work 
As well as Clark, Nolan was championed by Bryan Robertson, the influential director of the Whitechapel Gallery
 The gallery hosted a major and important retrospective in 1957 to honour Nolan’s 40th birthday; a huge critical and commercial success, it succeeded in putting Australian art firmly on the British map
Nolan’s 1957 painting The Death of the Poet

The poet and critic Al Alvarez summed up Nolan’s appeal to the English somewhat cynically, though perhaps with some accuracy, when he said that in Nolan’s work “it seemed possible for [the English] once again to discuss paintings without ever quite discussing paint
” The English were embedded in a literary tradition and were, according to Alvarez, bored by “painterly values”
 Eager buyers such as the writers CP Snow and Stephen Spender were drawn to Nolan’s literary and lyrical qualities, while Clark himself was encouraged by Nolan’s reinvigoration of figurative painting
 “When time has weeded out [Nolan’s] colossal output and the didactic snobbery of abstract art has declined he will be of even greater renown,” Clark later wrote in his autobiography
    It seemed possible for them once again to discuss paintings without ever quite discussing paint – Al Alvarez 
But whatever Nolan painted after leaving his native Australia, what he always will be remembered for are his early Ned Kelly paintings
 Bright, bold, strikingly cartoonish and yet compositionally complex, a tragicomic mood haunts the series
Nolan’s depiction of Kelly as a black square
Nolan’s depiction of Kelly as a black square, as shown here in his 1956 painting Kelly, was an instantly iconographic image (Credit: Sidney Nolan Trust)
In the 1970-71 painting Ned Kelly, Kelly himself appears as a black silhouette, clad in his clunky DIY armour to protect him from police bullets
 His head is not even head-shaped, but simply a flat square
 Through his cut-out slot for eyes, you can see the vast sky and horizon of the Australian outback
 It was an instantly iconographic image, reminiscent not only of Malevich’s modernist black square, but also – especially where we find Kelly astride his horse in perhaps the most famous image of the series – of a crusading knight
 Nolan deliberately and comically subverted the old ideals of nobility and civility associated with the Old World to suit the rougher contours of the New World
Kelly’s cypher figure isn’t deployed simply to illustrate the young bushranger’s story, but to capture something quintessentially Australian: the rebel streak of the outlander who animates this robust, rough and inhospitable terrain, one involuntarily settled by British and Irish convicts

From mousy ‘Shy Di’ in puff-sleeved pastels to chic, sleek, internationally renowned fashion star, the life of the late Diana, Princess of Wales was an epic journey – sartorially, and in every sense
 And the fact that Diana retains her style-muse status – two decades on from her shocking death – speaks volumes about the powerful impact she made
 Her early unsophisticated look, previously dismissed in fashion circles as ‘Sloaney’ and uncool, has become the epitome of fashion in 2017
Marking the 20-yearanniversary of her tragic death, Diana’s style evolution is explored in the exhibition Diana: Her Fashion Story at Kensington Palace
 Although Diana has frequently been cast as a victim, what emerges from the exhibition is the sense that she was a strong-minded, independent woman, one who actively championed her chosen causes and personal goals
 The collection of outfits on display explores Diana as an innovator in visual messaging, a disrupter of convention, and a pioneer in the way she turned her own narrative into her brand
 After those early, guileless Lady Di days – including the famously revealing backlit photograph in a semi-transparent skirt – she learned the rules of public dressing and, significantly, learned how to bend and break those rules

The floral prints, pie-crust collars, high-waisted jeans and pussy-bow blouses that Diana sported in the early days of her public life are now everywhere in fashion
 A recent collection for Asos was a direct homage, featuring pearl-trim shift dresses and Sloaney kilts; many designers, including the influential JW Anderson, have drawn on classic Di trademarks such as the currently ubiquitous voluminous, billowing sleeves
    She quietly signaled a departure from the famously buttoned-up, rigid royal codes 
So why has the early-Di look struck such a chord now
 “Fashion is cyclical, and so various trends will always make a re-appearance,” Eleri Lynn, curator of the exhibition, tells BBC Culture
 “Diana, Princess of Wales’s power was that when she wore something, the look was so copied and so emulated that it became almost definitively hers, such was her cultural impact – the pink Emanuel ‘New Romantic’ style blouse she wore was immediately dubbed the ‘Lady Di Blouse’, and is still known that way
”

Not that Diana was the first royal to set trends
 As Lynn explains: “The Royal Family has a long tradition of being fashionable, dating back centuries probably, as high-society sought to emulate their style
 Princess Margaret, for example, was regarded as highly fashionable and the press reported often on her wardrobe
 I think the difference is that Lady Diana Spencer stepped on to the international stage at a time when the media itself was changing – with rolling news, tabloid journalism, and the dawn of the digital age – and so the effect of Diana’s wardrobe on wider public trends was much more immediate than ever before
 She quickly learned how to use her image to communicate her messages and goals however, and to help her to do the job at hand
”
The exhibition explores this process
 “It’s been fascinating to look at some of the risks Diana took with fashion,” says Lynn
 “She learned the unwritten rules of royal dressing, and she liked to break them sometimes, even with tiny touches of something daring
 She was the first female royal to wear trousers to an evening event
 She liked to wear tuxedo-style outfits and she wore a lot of black – a colour usually only worn by the royal family for mourning
”

It was a subtle kind of subversion
 A Bill Pashley tweed skirt suit worn for the official honeymoon photograph with Charles, Prince of Wales, at Balmoral adhered to the traditional royal country-dressing rules in the fabric, while also cleverly bending those rules in the voluminous shape of the jacket
 The informal, on-trend blouson shape referenced a more current style and quietly signalled a departure from the famously buttoned-up, rigid royal codes
“In the Tudor period the message was clearly to project status and majesty,” says Lynn
 “The modern Royal Family project diplomatic messages with their clothes
” Diana knew what was required of her, and collaborated with designers “to communicate the regal, soft-power diplomacy that was part of her job
” Many of Diana’s dresses were created by Catherine Walker and Co, her most long-standing designer
 Walker herself died in 2010, and the Chelsea atelier continues under her business partner and now widower, Cyrus Said, who tells BBC Culture: “We were guided by the origins of royal dressing
 Queen Mary and Queen Alexandra and their era which exuded elegance and luxury
”
Breaking taboos
Tradition and history certainly mattered, but Diana and her collaborators continued to add twists and tweaks, promoting British fashion worldwide in the process
 She dressed in an increasingly ‘glamazonian’ style as she entered the so-called ‘Dynasty Di’ phase of the mid-1980s, adopting more embellishments and strong-shouldered silhouettes
 The green sequinned, wide-shouldered evening gown by Catherine Walker that she wore in 1986 is a standout example of, as Walker herself had put it, a “dignified showstopper”
 Curator Lynn says: “She certainly enjoyed expressing her personality through her dress, and playfully added personal touches to her look that conveyed her own sense of fun – such as wearing mismatched accessories or bold statement pieces
 The designer David Sassoon recalls that she often had a playful glint in her eye when trying clothes on, and remarking: ‘Oh, they’re going to love this
’”

The so-called ‘Elvis dress’ that Diana wore in 1989 was even more daring and glitzy, and another Catherine Walker creation
 A strapless white silk-crepe number teamed with a shimmering stand-up collared jacket, embroidered with luminous sequins and pearls, it was fabulously over the top
 Cyrus Said says that the design process with Diana was always “an intimate collaboration
 A beautiful dress is not per se a thing of beauty – it’s a combination of or a tension between the woman and the dress
 The designer should be in the supporting role, giving her the tools she needs to get the job done
 It’s about the union of the woman and the dress, which is how we operate
”
    She said she wanted to be a work-horse, not a clothes-horse – Eleri Lynn 
Diana’s mid-’80s look was glamorous, at times excessive – and completely of the moment
 “The [Dynasty] look was very popular,” says curator Lynn, “It reflected the power dressing that was fashionable at the time, when women were seen to be stepping into the boardroom and using power suits to project authority
  And you actually start to see her move away from the seasonal changes in fashion from this point onwards, to develop more of a timeless look
  This is when she started to have confidence in her own sense of style, and in what suited her
” The sweeping Victor Edelstein midnight-blue velvet evening dress, worn at a state dinner at the White House in 1985 when the princess famously danced with Hollywood star John Travolta, was another key moment in Diana’s story
 Images of the pair gliding gracefully around the dancefloor filled TV screens and newspapers across the globe
 It was a bold – subtly maverick – message of glamour, confidence and independence

Following Diana’s separation from Prince Charles and having dropped the HRH in her title, she had more freedom to experiment with some non-British designers, for instance with the sleek, ice-blue beaded Versace gown that she wore for a Harper’s Bazaar cover shoot with photographer Patrick Demarchelier in 1991
 She appeared in this phase of her life to come into her own, and seemed at her most slick, elegant and focussed
 She forged her new public role, championing a number of charitable and humanitarian causes
 “She said she wanted to be a work-horse, not a clothes-horse,” says Lynn, “and simplified her look in order to focus the press attention on her work not her wardrobe
” The shift dresses, simple skirt suits and the classic white shirt-and-chinos combination (which she wore for her landmine charity trips) conveyed a brisk professionalism
 And in 1997 Diana donated 79 of her most lavish dresses for auction at Christie’s in New York, raising a hefty £3
4 million for cancer and HIV charities
 As Said Cyrus puts it: “Her legacy was the way she used her position to help save lives
”

“She had a lasting impact on the way the public perceived those suffering from Aids and HIV,” Lynn says
 “She hardly ever wore gloves, but on one famous occasion when she did, she very conspicuously removed them to hold hands with an Aids patient, breaking the taboo surrounding the disease
 [She was] using dress to really hammer home her point
 On official engagements, Diana thought really carefully about who she was meeting and how she would be perceived

“She dressed to communicate approachability and warmth – to encourage informality – as she did by wearing cheerful, less formal clothing to children’s hospitals
 David Sassoon’s 1988 blue dress with printed flowers was named by the princess her ‘caring’ dress because children loved it
  David sketched it with a hat but she never ordered it as she said ‘you can’t cuddle a child in a hat’
 Her legacy was in the humanitarian causes she championed and in the people whose lives she touched
” Undisputed fashion icon though she was, Diana is likely to be remembered for much more than her pie-crust collars or her shimmering gowns

The Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell isn’t just one of the most acclaimed science-fiction cartoons ever made, it’s one of the most acclaimed science-fiction films, full stop
 Conceptually and visually breathtaking, Mamoru Oshii’s cyberpunk detective flick bridged the gap between analogue blockbusters and digital ones, between Blade Runner and The Terminator, with their cyborgs and androids, and The Matrix and Avatar, with their body-swaps and virtual realities
 The makers of The Matrix, in particular, were happy to acknowledge that they were following in Oshii’s future-noir footsteps
The question is, then, is it worth bothering with a belated live-action version
 Considering that the cartoon is now a cult classic, and that several other films have taken its innovations and run with them, can a mega-budget Hollywood remake have anything of its own to offer
 The answer to both questions is a definite yes
    The core concepts are no longer as jaw-dropping as they were 22 years ago 
It’s true that the core concepts are no longer as jaw-dropping as they were 22 years ago
 Back in 1995, it was much weirder to see a world in which everyone was plugged into a network so that they could communicate and access information at the speed of thought
 But the plotting has been updated and expanded deftly
 Sacrilegious as may be to say it, the original anime Ghost in the Shell always felt as if it would have benefited from an extra half-hour’s running time
 There were all sorts of characters and bureaucratic organisations which were introduced at exhausting length, only to vanish without trace
 At 80 minutes, it came across as the opening chapter of a sprawling saga, rather than a complete story
 In contrast, the new film, scripted by Jamie Moss, William Wheeler and Ehren Kruger (and, reportedly, many others), explores and resolves its ideas satisfyingly - which is not to say that it won’t lead to a sequel or three
Scarlett Johansson plays a woman who was so grievously injured in a terrorist attack that only her brain could be saved
 Fortunately for her, it was then transferred to a smooth, shiny, manufactured body which happened to be the same shape as Scarlett Johansson’s
 If that weren’t enough of an upgrade, her state-of-the-art chassis comes with built-in super strength and camouflaging technology
 (The parallels with Robocop, and with Frankenstein, are more explicit than they were in the anime
) Left with only a few murky memories of her previous life, the woman is code-named the Major and recruited by the Government’s heavily armed anti-terrorism response squad, Section 9
A year later, the very scientists who built this bionic woman are being assassinated
 Their own robots are being reprogrammed and turned against them by a mysterious hacker (Michael Pitt) who bears a distinct resemblance to Julian Assange, as portrayed in The Fifth Estate
 Together with her ragtag teammates, the Major investigates by dropping into sleazy back-alley bars and sending her consciousness zipping through cyberspace, uncovering the secrets of her own past along the way
Doom and gloom
The new Ghost in the Shell is a lot more coherent than the old one
 Both a nightmarish body horror-movie and a hard-boiled conspiracy thriller, it slots in plenty of images and scenes from the anime, while forging a narrative of its own (something which another film adapted from a 1990s cartoon, Beauty and the Beast, woefully failed to do)
 Perhaps the writers have gone too far in spelling out their themes
 Some of the clunky expositional dialogue will have purists wincing, and they’ll certainly roll their eyes when one character explains the title: “Your body – your shell – may be synthetic, but your soul – your ghost – is still in it
” But it’s probably for the best that the film’s story is reasonably straightforward when the spectacle and atmosphere it conjures up are so extraordinary
    I was afraid I was going to have a panic attack 
It’s all set in one overcrowded Hong Kong-like metropolis
 Any space that isn’t taken up by skyscrapers is taken up by skyscraper-sized holograms which loom like indifferent deities over the dark streets
 There are road markings which change as you drive towards them, there are monstrous people with metal arms who could have wandered in from Judge Dredd (the comic strip, that is, not either of the films), and there are grimy, rubbish-strewn neighbourhoods in the shadow of gleaming glass corporate tower blocks
 It’s a city which is defined by artificiality: you never know if you’re talking to a human, a cyborg, a robot or a hologram
 And yet, paradoxically, this elaborately designed and detailed dystopia seems disturbingly real
 I saw the film in 3D on an Imax screen, and there were times when it was so vertiginous and oppressive that I was afraid I was going to have a panic attack
Be warned, though: anyone who is irritated by the doom and gloom in DC’s recent superhero outings will be infuriated by Ghost in the Shell, which is often grim and portentous enough to make Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice look like The Lego Batman Movie
 Its director, after all, is Rupert Sanders
 His debut, Snow White and the Huntsman, took a whimsical fairy tale and made it into a particularly dour episode of Game of Thrones, and he hasn’t lightened up since then
Another striking aspect of his vision is how multi-ethnic it is
 The cast includes a French woman (Juliette Binoche) as the harried, maternal doctor who brought the Major back to life, a Danish man (Pilou Asbaek) as the Major’s tough and loyal sidekick, and a Japanese man (‘Beat’ Takeshi Kitano) as her commanding officer
 Johansson’s casting was controversial, because her character has been changed from Asian to Caucasian, but in the context of the diverse society presented by the film, it works
 It’s also undeniable that, having starred in Lucy, Under the Skin and The Avengers, Johansson is the obvious choice to play a troubled, not-quite-mortal fighting machine, even if her jerky, robotic gait takes some getting used to
The other characters have more personality than their animated counterparts did, but they are still too sketchy to register as individuals you can care about
 They are essentially walking, talking action figures, and their stylish blankness makes Ghost in the Shell easier to admire than to love
 The film could have had slightly more humour and humanity beneath its surface: more of a ghost in its shell, in other words
 But what a stunning shell it is
“Is there a right length of time to look at – or engage with – an artwork
” asks Linda Kennedy in this video from Art Basel Hong Kong
 “What’s worth a glance
 What deserves a gaze
”
The annual Slow Art Day encourages people to choose a few pieces of art and stare longer
 “In an art fair like this, people are just racing around, trying to take photos, see as much as they can take in,” says art critic Payal Uttam
 “Slow art is really the polar opposite – it’s about taking time
”
Kennedy spends a few minutes with Belgian artist Luc Tuymans, navigating the contours of one of his paintings
 She also talks to the performance artist Enoch Cheng, who believes the Slow Art movement “gives us the space again to look again, to even do nothing – that is a very precious space, it’s almost like a luxury now
”
Six years after she won an Oscar for her role as a ballerina in Black Swan, Natalie Portman is up for the best actress award again – this time, for her performance as First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in Jackie
“When you make something, you’re starting a dialogue that needs to be finished by the audience, so when people respond in a positive, enthusiastic way it’s very exciting,” she tells Tom Brook
The film looks beyond what she represented to the public
 “Her image has become so iconic – the Andy Warhol silkscreen version of her that we hold in our minds as the one-time queen of our country – this tells her as a human being, and her interior life
”

David George Haskell, The Songs of Trees
Haskell makes repeated visits to a dozen trees around the world
 “The forest presses its mouth to every living creature and exhales,” he writes in the Amazonian rainforest in Ecuador, a place of unrivaled plant diversity
 There he climbs to the crown of a giant ceiba tree at least 150 years old and traces its connections to plant, animal, bacterial and fungal life
 He visits an olive plantation in Jerusalem, and tracks seasons of new growth after a green ash falls on the Cumberland plateau in Kentucky
 On New York’s Upper West Side he wires a Callery pear planted above the subway, describing how the city’s sounds affect the tree’s growth (“when a plant is shaken, it grows more roots”)
 Each acutely observed essay is resonant as a poem

Nick Joaquin, The Woman Who Had Two Navels and Tales of the Tropical Gothic
For the centenary of his birth comes the first US publication of a compilation of work from Filipino writer Nick Joaquin, including his best-known stories and the 1966 play A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino
 Joaquin’s writing is laced with references to his country’s colonial history, Catholicism and pre-Christian rituals
 The “two navels” in the title story refer to symbolic ties to Spanish and American colonial periods
 (The once-heroic father in the story, who chooses exile in Hong Kong over American occupation, is overcome with despair when he finds his ancestral house in Dinondo destroyed
) May Day Eve and The Summer Solstice dramatise the lure of pagan celebrations (in the latter, Dona Lupe is transformed after joining dancing village women: “her eyes brimmed with moonlight, and her mouth with laughter”)

David Owen, Where the Water Goes
New Yorker staff writer Owen examines the origins, scope and current state of the Colorado river in the American West that supplies water to more than 36 million people, irrigates six million acres of farmland, and powers two of the country’s largest hydroelectric plants
 Over the last century the river’s water has been “over-allocated,” Owen writes; this imbalance has been exacerbated by the drought in the West
 He brings us to key spots along the river, from the Grand Canyon to Las Vegas, the Imperial Valley, and the Salton Sea
 He describes struggles with water shortages, and solutions that may arise in the future, including desalinization, diverting other rivers, and cloud seeding
 Where the Water Goes is an eloquent argument for addressing the impact of human inhabitants on the natural world

Leonora Carrington, The Complete Stories
Carrington, the surrealist painter, was also a writer of strangely dark and unearthly short stories, collected here for the first time (and including three previously unpublished tales) – those in French are translated by Kathrine Talbot, those in Spanish by Anthony Kerrigan
 Born in Lancashire on the day the US declared war on Germany, Carrington ran off to France with Max Ernst at 19
 When he was interned, she became unhinged and ended up in an asylum, given the pharmaceutical equivalent of shock treatment
 Witness to cruelties and terrible disruptions of reality, Carrington wrote stories filled with fluid creatures caught somewhere between animal, vegetable, mineral and human
 One narrator sends a hyena in her place to her debutante ball; another visits a nearby house to discover her neighbors are long dead, possibly vampires
 Like her paintings, Carrington’s stories are hauntingly original

Anne Garreta, Not One Day
“There’s only one key to unlock the secret of our subjectivity: desire,” writes French author Garreta, a member of the Oulipo school, which sets structural constraints on literary composition
 The narrator of this short novel, translated from the French by Emma Ramadan, in its first English translation, commits to writing five hours a day for a month, recounting memories of lovers past
 The goal: “not one day without a woman
” More than a year later, she has written a dozen portraits
 There’s *B, whose attractiveness is “a super acute mental intensity”, pursued with uncertainty one night in Rome, and *E, who turns seductive after a boring academic symposium
 These encounters and others unfold as Garreta pursues her playful task of “confession, or how to scrape the bottoms of mirrors”
 Not One Day won France’s Prix Médicis

Adam Kirsch, The Global Novel: Writing the World in the 21st Century
Award-winning critic Adam Kirsch achieves a fresh take on world literature in this collection of essays about eight global writers who encompass six languages and five continents
 What unites these eight, Kirsch argues, “is the insistence on the global dimension not just of contemporary experience, but of contemporary imagination
” The new migrant novel is one of the most significant literary expressions of the 21st Century
 In Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Americanah and Mosin Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist, the US is “a stage of life rather than a final destination”
 Examining these plus Orhan Pamuk’s Snow, Margaret Atwood’s Oryx and Crake, Haruki Murakami’s IQ84, Roberto Bolano’s 2666, Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels and Houllebecq’s The Possibility of an Island, Kirsch gives hope for “the capacity of fiction to reveal humanity to itself”

A Quiet Passion
British director Terence Davies (House of Mirth, The Deep Blue Sea) delivers what The New Yorker describes as “an absolute drop-dead masterwork” and “an urgent outpouring of pent-up creative energy” with this biopic of the 19th-Century poet Emily Dickinson
 Cynthia Nixon stars in a drama that is “both a celebration of the creative spirit, and a poignant reminder of its fragility” – although portraying a life that was outwardly uneventful, it reveals “a fiery, passionate figure who questioned every aspect of the patriarchal society in which she lived”
 Nixon’s Dickinson “seems to rise outward from the bone”, and Davies achieves more than a straightforward depiction of the poet’s life: instead, “he creates a world that is, above all, her inner world”

Their Finest
The latest from Danish director Lone Scherfig (An Education) is “a relentlessly charming romantic comedy” that is “broad and rib-nudging when it wants, understated and dignified when it needs to be”, according to Variety
 Adapted from a novel by Lissa Evans, Their Finest takes its name from a speech by Winston Churchill, and stars Gemma Arterton as a copywriter hired to script propaganda films during World War Two
 Sam Claflin co-stars as a fellow screenwriter in an ensemble cast including Richard E Grant, Helen McCrory and Bill Nighy
 Arterton’s performance has been praised by the Hollywood Reporter for its “grace and understatement” and Claflin “reveals maturity and dry humour… in a film that celebrates old-fashioned screen storytelling with infectious fondness”

The Handmaiden
Park Chan-Wook (Oldboy) transposes Sarah Waters’ crime novel Fingersmith, which was set in Victorian Britain, to 1930s-era colonial Korea and Japan in this erotic psychological thriller
 It tells the story of a Korean woman engaged as a maid who becomes involved in a conman’s plot to defraud her mistress of a large inheritance
 It’s one of the best films yet from “the master of classy trash”, according to The Chicago Sun-Times: “There’s artistry in his film-making, but also a lot of blood, plenty of sick humour and moments of sheer lunacy
” It’s also a visual treat, winning a prize for art direction at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival
 “Kinky by design, artful by intent, the film draws visual inspiration from Gothic erotic art,” says the Toronto Star
 “Come for the sexy mystery, stay for the immaculate production design
” Released 7 April in Norway, 12 April in Denmark and 14 April in Ireland

Free Fire
Ben Wheatley (Sightseers, High-Rise) steps into Tarantino territory with a drama that brings two opposing gangs together in a shootout and game of survival in a deserted warehouse: but this is no Reservoir Dogs
 “The kind of glamorous ‘clean kills’ on which the entire tradition of the Hollywood shoot-out has been built are conspicuous by their absence,” says the Telegraph
 “Pop-culture monologues come in for equally short shrift
” According to Empire, “this is a sleeker and more violent film”
 Despite a sprawling cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Brie Larson and Armie Hammer, the action is masterfully controlled – Sight and Sound argues that “What might be messy in less capable hands is simply dynamic here
” This is a “crime caper steeped in blood and banter”

Your Name
This low-budget anime has gained momentum since its release, becoming the highest-grossing Japanese film in history
 However director Makoto Shinkai (The Garden of Words) is uncomfortable with the success of his time-shifting, body-swapping supernatural love story
 He told the South China Morning Post that “It’s not healthy
 I don’t think any more people should see it
” He has also rejected comparisons with master animator Hayao Miyazaki, saying “I am absolutely not at Miyazaki’s level”
 Yet some critics gave it five-star reviews while also praising Shinkai for finding his own unique voice: The Observer’s Mark Kermode claims that “this rip-roaring, heartbreaking YA adventure is very much its own beast, as different from Miyazaki’s ageless Studio Ghibli animations as it is from live-action western romps”, and according to The Independent “Shinkai manages to combine romance, gender politics, a quest saga, a story of adolescent angst, and a time travel yarn while addressing post-Fukushima fears of disaster”
 Released 7 April in Spain and the US and 12 April in Sweden

It is one of the iconic photographs of the 20th Century, an image that is synonymous with love and with Paris, the city of romance
 Its name is Le Baiser de l’Hôtel de Ville (The Kiss by the Hôtel de Ville) and an exhibition at the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin is currently displaying it alongside another hundred or so pictures by the great French photographer Robert Doisneau
“People like my photos because they see in them what they would see if they stopped rushing about and took the time to enjoy the city,” Robert Doisneau used to say
 It is very true, however, perhaps surprisingly, his most famous picture was staged, says Francine Deroudille, Robert Doisneau’s daughter and co-curator of the exhibition, as she reveals the story behind Le Baiser de l’Hôtel de Ville to BBC Culture
Anita
Over 100 images by Doisneau, including this portrait of Mademoiselle Anita, 1951, are on display at the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin (Credit: Atelier Robert Doisneau, 2016)
“The picture was taken in the spring 1950
 My father’s agent had pitched a series on ‘the lovers of Paris’ to American publications and Life magazine had commissioned it,” Deroudille explains
    Truth here lies in the beauty of the impulse and a spontaneity that is closely linked to the French spirit and its capital city 
At the time, image rights were already protected by law and a cautious Robert Doisneau preferred to use friends or young actors to feature in some of his commissioned reportage, in order to avoid legal issues
 One afternoon in March 1950, Doisneau went out into the streets of Paris with young actor friends and just let them be: they walked, held hands, talked, and kissed, with Doisneau never far behind
 “His models weren’t models in the sense that they didn’t pose
 Doisneau was simply catching them flirting and kissing, in a very natural way, ” says Deroudille
The result, a kiss caught at the corner of rue du Renard and rue de Rivoli right across from the city’s town hall, feels like the best of Doisneau: a suspended moment whose beauty is known only to the lovers and the photographer
 Around them, indifferent Parisians walk, hardly noticing the young couple; cars shoot by and people seated at a café (now a shoe shop) speak animatedly
The Kiss

But, we, sharing Doisneau’s gaze, stop in our tracks in front of this picture: the immediacy of it, the young bodies’ movement and the place and time, Paris, 1950, cast a spell on the viewer
 Who cares about authenticity
 The sentiments showed in the picture are authentic
 Truth here lies in the beauty of the impulse and a spontaneity that is closely linked to the French spirit and its capital city
“At the time, American magazines were very keen on Paris stories, especially stories covering the life in Paris streets where people behaved much more freely than anywhere in America
 Even in New York’s streets, couples weren’t seen kissing, and certainly never with such carefree abandon,” says Francine Deroudille
However, after it was shot, and published in Life Magazine, the picture remained just one of many in the very large Doisneau portfolio (today totalling 450,000 negatives, and managed by his two daughters Francine and Annette)
 Doisneau himself didn’t think it such an extraordinary picture

“He thought it was well composed but nothing more” says his daughter
 “And then, 30 years later, in the early 1980s, a young publisher suggested to publish it again, in poster format
 Doisneau wasn’t convinced but all the young people at the Rapho agency where he worked were so enthusiastic that he accepted
” The success was instant and global
 How did Doisneau explain his picture’s sudden and universal success
 “We all realised that it represented a perfect fantasy
 It encapsulates the world’s view of Paris as the city of love and freedom
”
‘A humanist photographer’
Robert Doisneau’s photographs are intimately associated with Paris at a time when the city was the world capital of arts and culture
 “He was in awe of Paris and his love never faltered until his death in 1994,” says Deroudille
 Doisneau documented Paris’s evolution from the 1930s up to the late 1980s; he saw and often welcomed both social and architectural changes
 “Paris has this intrinsic beauty which touches everyone who visits or lives here
 Paris has this ability of making you happy, it certainly made him very happy,” reveals Deroudille
Josette

Doisneau wasn’t the only one fascinated by Paris’s grandeur and its myriad small pleasures
 Eugène Atget, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Brassaï, André Kertész, Willy Ronis, Robert Capa, among many others, have made Paris the most photographed city of the 20th Century
 Their pictures have shaped the world’s perception of the city, enhancing and enchanting the reality
 Decades later, we still see Paris as a place where mystery and charm take you by surprise at almost every corner
    Paris streets, in which Parisians lived day and night to escape small, shabby and decrepit lodgings, offered the best of theatre 
Much of Doisneau’s work came out of commissions from newspapers and magazines, but he always used his assignments as opportunities to catch moments that interested him personally
 With his Rolleiflex, he photographed building facades, interiors, river banks, children playing, passers-by, wedding couples

“He felt comfortable everywhere, in the poor areas and the posh districts of Paris
 What he enjoyed most was to show all the facets of Paris even if he had a particular fondness for Paris’s children and its working class,” says Deroudille
 Often referred to as a ‘humanist photographer’, Doisneau’s pictures focused on people by making the private and the personal visible
 For decades, Paris streets, in which Parisians lived day and night to escape small, shabby and decrepit lodgings, offered the best of theatre
 “Parisians don’t live as much in the streets as they used to, however, cafés’ terraces, the habit of walking and ‘flâner’, the concentration of shops such as bakeries and food markets, mean that the spirit remains and continues to fascinate visitors,” says Francine Deroudille
But what would Doisneau make of today’s photography
 Of selfies and Instagram fads
 “He would have loved to see that photography had become accessible to all
 However, [I] am sure he would have been aghast by the selfie culture which, in many ways, is a vain obsession with the self to the detriment of a wider view,” says Deroudille
Doisneau, a modest man, valued empathy with others, simplicity, and above all, spontaneity
I Am Not Your Negro
Inspired by an unfinished James Baldwin book about the assassinations of black leaders in the 1960s, Raoul Peck’s documentary brings Baldwin, who died in 1987, into the 21st Century, where his scorching appraisal of the history of race in the US is, unfortunately, as timely as ever
 Drawing from decades of Baldwin’s writing and public statements – although rarely touching Baldwin’s work on sexuality – the movie is less a summary than a séance, with Samuel L Jackson’s impassioned narration all but bringing him back to life
 Peck intercuts footage of the Ferguson protests to underline how relevant Baldwin remains, but in a world in which the basic humanity of people of colour is under attack, the continued vitality of Baldwin’s ideas is already unassailable

Get Out
Described as “Rosemary's Baby meets The Help” – or, alternatively, a cross between Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner and The Stepford Wives – the big-screen writing/directing debut of Key & Peele’s Jordan Peele is a horror thriller about a black man who discovers that his white girlfriend’s parents are involved in a sinister conspiracy to keep their wealthy suburb racially monochrome
 Get Out starts with a premise befitting a solid Twilight Zone episode, but at least to judge from its trailer, things start to get truly nuts after that
 Mainstream horror has been suffering from a lack of ingenuity, but a great comedy writer turning his skills to the genre could give it just the boost it needs

Personal Shopper
The Kristen Stewart’s renaissance continues with Olivier Assayas’ lyrical, unnerving story about a celebrity factotum obsessed with trying to communicate with her dead twin brother
 Apart from the engrossing stillness of Stewart’s performance, the movie’s most intriguing aspect is the way it plays the supernatural completely straight, as if it’s a given that the spirits of those who have passed on regularly lurk around the edges of otherwise realist dramas
 Like Assayas and Stewart’s Clouds of Sils Maria, it’s a movie that takes mystery for granted, an approach that allows her to inhabit her character rather than having her drive the plot, and the less she does, the more fascinating a performer she becomes

It’s hard to envision a stranger match-up than Sofia Coppola and the Western genre, but that’s just what makes this remake of a Don Siegel/Clint Eastwood oater so intriguing
 Although it’s set during the Civil War, the story of a wounded Union soldier (Colin Farrell) who seeks shelter in a Confederate girls school is a seduction at heart, and the photos from Coppola’s set suggest she’s doubling down on the original’s languorousness
 It’s hard to imagine how Coppola’s take on this most masculine of genres might turn out, but that’s what’s exciting about it

Dunkirk
Christopher Nolan’s dedication to old-school techniques may strike some as pure Luddism, but an epic battle movie shot on 65mm celluloid and relying on practical effects is enough of a dwindling rarity that every remaining instance is cause for celebration
 Although comparisons to Saving Private Ryan will be inevitable, Dunkirk is not about an Allied military victory but the mass evacuation of more than 300,000 soldiers from a French beach, which is an atypical subject for a film of this massive scale
 It’s long been said – including of Private Ryan – that it’s impossible to make a combat movie that’s truly anti-war, but telling a story about escape rather than engagement might be a way to finally solve that conundrum

It’s been five long years since Tomas Alfredson’s stylishly grungy Cold War thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, but this adaptation of Jo Nesbø’s murder mystery sounds like it might be worth the wait
 Michael Fassbender stars as a detective on the trail of what may be Norway’s first serial killer, with Rebecca Ferguson as a like-minded detective and a cast that also includes Charlotte Gainsbourg, JK Simmons and Val Kilmer
 It’s a bit odd to have Alfredson returning to his native Scandinavia with an English-speaking cast in tow, but it’ll be great to see what he does on familiarly chilly turf with a Hollywood-sized budget

We’ll never get to see Edgar Wright’s Ant-Man, but with any luck, the action chops he honed preparing for that movie before Marvel replaced him – for, in effect, trying to make an Edgar Wright movie – will pay off in this story about a mute wheelman (Ansel Elgort) who uses music to guide his getaway driving
 It’s the first time Wright, who’s collaborated with Simon Pegg on most of his scripts, has gotten sole screenplay credit, which seems like the perfect way for him to declare his independence from the Marvel machine, and with a cast that also includes Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey, he’s assembled a superhero group of his own

Expecting an auteur stamp on a Marvel movie is a mug’s game, but call us mugs: the pairing of a Thor/Hulk “buddy movie” and director Taika Waititi could produce inspired results
 Waititi, the Kiwi director known for comedies like What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, brings much-needed levity to the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most dour and unengaging subfranchise, and might even give Chris Hemsworth a chance to employ the comic chops he showed off in Ghostbusters and Vacation
 Of course, it won’t be all laughs: the movie’s subtitle refers to Norse mythology’s end of the world
 But if Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo get to play Hope and Crosby along the way, maybe the journey to apocalypse won’t be so bad after all

Looper and Brick’s Rian Johnson remains the most intriguing directorial hire in the history of Star Wars, as well as the only person besides George Lucas to both write and direct one of the franchise’s movies
 It’s unlikely that the still-untitled Episode VIII will be as idiosyncratic as Johnson’s The Brothers Bloom, but after JJ Abrams’ solid but unspectacular table-setting, this latest trilogy is on good footing to try something a little bit new
 Hard details on the movie, naturally, are scarce, but if Abrams’ Spielberg-isms felt too familiar, Johnson could be the one to liven things up

Downsizing
After chronicling the quotidian disaffections of life in the Midwest, it only stands to reason that Alexander Payne would turn to the story of people who have themselves shrunken to a tiny size to join communities of like-minded, like-sized people
 Right
 Downsizing has been a passion project of Payne’s for years, but it seemed unlikely that a director known for dry-wit comedies would get the leeway, or the cash, to venture into sci-fi
 It’s an outlandish idea from a director who’s not known for them – although he and writing partner Jim Taylor did touch up the script for Jurassic Park III – but finding out what the hell this thing is will be part of the fun

Glass floors are rarely less than exciting
 Will they bear your weight
 Might they trigger vertigo
 Here’s one way of finding out, The Ledge, a pair of retractable glass pods projecting from the 103rd floor of Chicago’s Willis Tower, the second tallest building in the western hemisphere
 Designed by the 1973 skyscraper’s original architects – SOM (Skidmore Owings Merrill) – the rectangular pods are clad all around in three layers of half-inch glass bonded together
 They may be safe and yet it still takes some visitors real courage to step into what appears to be thin air so very high above the Chicago River
 Views across four states and down below to city streets make this leap of faith more than worthwhile

Mayakovskaya Metro station, Moscow
Is this a glimpse of the Soviet workers’ paradise that never was
 Possibly
 This is, in fact, one of the most striking of the elaborate Moscow Metro stations built in the 1930s
 Designed by Alexey Dushkin and opened in 1938, Mayakovskaya station served as a far from Spartan air-raid shelter during World War Two
 It was also a command post for anti-aircraft guns and an assembly hall for speeches by Stalin
 It is strange to think, in the thick of modern commuting, that the Russian dictator once strode along Dushkin’s floor, an immaculate geometric composition 33-metres below ground, realised in four shades of granite and marble and crowned with decorative panels depicting the Soviet Union’s mastery of the sky

 Built in 1933 as the head office of the Radio Corporation of America and now home to NBC television and broadcasting, “30 Rock” is, in part, open to the public who share the walk along this cinematic floor, all black and beige geometry shining ebony and gold under subtle lighting
 Here is one of those walks, and one of those Manhattan towers, rushed up in the Great Depression that lifted spirits then as now

Siena Cathedral
For John Ruskin, the influential Victorian critic so fond of Venetian Gothic, Siena’s black and white 13th Century cathedral was in “every way absurd”, an “over-cut, overstriped piece of costly confectionery and faithless vanity”
 The cathedral’s design is certainly a matter of taste, although perhaps its finest moment – its floor – is concealed from view for most of the year
 This great carpet of inlaid marble, created by generations of artists and artisans largely between the 14th and 16th Centuries is a gallery of art looked down on rather than walked through
 Seen as a whole it tells the story, in many styles, complex geometries and artistic deviations, of sacrifice and salvation

 Appearances, however, can be deceptive
 Some while after Napoleon Bonaparte marched into Turin in 1800, this grand floor was uplifted and moved to the city’s Galleria Beaumont, since 1837, the Royal Armoury
 What you see today is a 1995 replica of the original floor designed by Michelangelo Garove, architect to the House of Savoy, for the Palazzo Venaria, a palatial hunting lodge completed by Filippo Juvarra on the fringe of Turin
 The Grand Gallery – 15 metres high and 80 metres long – once connected the apartments of king and crown prince
 A barracks until 1978, the palace is now a museum, its gallery and chequerboard floor a favourite for advertising and publicity shoots

This glorious mid 18th Century Rococo confection designed by the Roman architects Nicola Salvi and Luigi Vanvitelli, was funded by rich seams of gold shipped to Lisbon from Brazil
 The church itself had begun life almost modestly in the 16th Century as the first Portuguese headquarters of the Jesuits
 By the time the Jesuits were expelled in 1759, it had become an architectural jewel box verging on kitsch
 And, yet, such sumptuous elements as the chapel’s mosaic floor crafted by a team led by Enrigo Enuo, to a design by the German painter Ignazio Stern and depicting an armillary sphere – the national symbol of Portugal during its Age of Discovery – continue to delight even as they dazzle the eye

 In the voluptuous interiors of the Heydar Aliyev Centre by Zaha Hadid Architects opened in 2012, it can be hard to say
 Here is a building designed in one continuous fluid movement
 From the plaza it unfurls from, it feels as if it is the work not so much of an architect-sculptor, as Hadid was, as a calligrapher writing in concrete and glass
 Of mosques, Hadid wrote: “Continuous calligraphic and ornamental patterns flow from carpets to walls, walls to ceilings, ceilings to domes establishing a seamless relationship and blurring distinctions between architectural elements and the ground they inhabit
” In this same thought, she was describing the Heydar Aliyev Centre

 Scarred, the magnificent floor of its arcaded courtyard survives

 A carpet of stone laid out in geometric patterns interrupted by a sundial and what are now bullet-riddled fountains, it paves the way to a complexity of interior spaces around the courtyard among them the shrine of Zechariah, father of John the Baptist

 When Vesuvius erupted in 79AD, mosaics adorning walls and floors were smothered in volcanic ash that hid and protected them
 This stunning sea-life mosaic depicting an enchantment of dogfish, sea bream, rays and a lobster in the clutches of an octopus was excavated in 1830
 On the way to the kitchen, it was a reminder of the wealth of seafood to he had in the Bay of Naples

Shirley Jackson was best known for literary suspense in the tradition of Hawthorne, Poe and Henry James
 Her 1948 story The Lottery is a horror classic, as are her novels The Haunting of Hill House (1959) and We Have Always Lived in the Castle (1962)
 But Jackson’s unique contribution, writes Franklin, was “her primary focus” on the lives of her generation of women who were raised in the mid 20th Century
 Franklin tracks Jackson’s mythmaking life from her girlhood in a northern Californian suburb through her marriage to literary critic Stanley Edgar Hyman, with whom she had four children
 They met at Syracuse University, where he began a lifetime of infidelities
 “Their sometimes tortured intimacy reverberates seismically through her work,” writes Franklin, who gives equal weight to Jackson’s life and work in this groundbreaking new biography

We live in the era of ‘truthiness, of ‘alternate facts’ and unfounded opinions presented as gospel truth
 Strutting into this arena, high-kicking and making cutesy shooting gestures under a pink cowboy hat, comes Australian director Kitty Green's witty, inventive, spikily illuminating hybrid documentary, Casting JonBenét
 Now, it’s not actually about JonBenét Ramsey, the six-year-old pageant queen found murdered in her Boulder, Colorado home on the afternoon of 26 December 1996
 It's about the mythology of her death, about the way everyone in the community and beyond has a theory about the killing and some sort of personal connection to it, manufactured or otherwise
 And most surprisingly, it is also about the gentle psychosis that is the acting process
    Truth might be stranger than fiction, but in its absence, fiction will have to do
There is nonetheless an ethical qualm raised by Green's approach
 By taking the stories, gossip and rumours surrounding JonBenét's death as her subject, Green's film operates at one further ironic remove from the visceral tragedy of that battered and strangled little body in the basement
 But it's a movie that persuasively argues that the truth, as in ‘what really happened’, is unknowable anyway
 Maybe now, 20 years later, the historiography of the JonBenét Ramsey murder case has more to tell us about this weird world of ours than its history
 Truth might be stranger than fiction, but in its absence, fiction will have to do and when the fiction is this variegated and multifaceted, it will do just fine
The foundational fiction of the film however, does feel a little dubious: the majority of Casting JonBenét is made up of "auditions" (shot and lit in a much more considered and less slipshod manner than standard casting tapes), for actors and non-professionals alike who are trying out for the roles of Patsy (JonBenét's mother), John (her father) and Burke (her brother) in a mooted film about the murder
 The subjects were apparently aware that material from their interviews might be used, but just how much they knew about the nature of Green's intent is unclear
    JonBenét herself is the least present character here
This niggles gently at the conscience all the way through to the film's extraordinary, perhaps self-justifying finale
 But it's especially present in moments played or edited for broad laughs of which the subjects themselves must have been unaware
 The burly "sex educator" trying out for the part of the police chief is the fall guy who’s abruptly returned to after a more serious section when the other subjects have been theorising regarding the highly suspect blackmail letter – he’s still intoning his sexual preferences, including "breast torture" and "nipple play
" It's a funny cut, but an unkind one
Playing dress-up
And it's not just in making her subjects the occasional butt of the joke that Green seems to be playing it a little disingenuously
 When one of the better actors to try out for John explains his reasons for participating he says that though it’s a ghoulish thing to do, it's "better than nothing", and maybe, in some obscure way "it would help
" But by that he of course means "help with solving the still-open murder case" and that is not, nor ever was Green's agenda here
It can't be said, however that ethical concerns will hamper one's enjoyment of a very enjoyable film
 The actors, many of them from the Boulder, Colorado area, are a fascinating bunch to spend time with, in some cases displaying real rage, sorrow or sympathy at the memory of JonBenét's death, at others summoning crocodile tears in the hopes of better recommending themselves to the casting panel, and at still others treating the audition as a confessional, or as therapy in telling personal stories of sudden death that have become conflated in their lives with the Ramsey case, so large did it loom
    The final section is essentially an art installation
Individually, they vigorously defend their own readings of the events of that Christmas
 They condemn or defend Patsy, John or Burke, or all three
 They wonder why the paedophilia angle wasn't better investigated
 They scorn the three-page blackmail letter, alternately point to or dismiss JonBenét's bedwetting as evidence of abuse or as the hair-trigger motivation for Patsy to commit the crime
 Green interviews mall Santas (involved in one of the more outré theories), and elicits a creepily impressive version of John Mark Carr, who falsely confessed to the murder, played by an actor whose level of research is a little frightening
 One of the Johns sums it up neatly by saying that there is no theory that fits all the facts that doesn't sound crazy – though that said, the lady who hints heavily at Satanic involvement due to all the sixes (JonBenét was 6, and died on 26 December 1996) is maybe a little further off-piste than most
 And throughout it all, Green intersperses fragments of scripted reconstruction, starring various Patsys and Johns in various configurations
Those scenes, in which the actors finally act, are ramping up to a final section that is essentially an art installation
 On a deliberately artificial soundstage, like a set for a sitcom, several rooms of the Ramsey house are recreated, connected by a hallway that leads off backstage
 In them, a multitude of Johns, Patsys and Burkes act out, in the shared spaces, the various scenarios the film has described
 This stunning, life-size, overpopulated diorama is simply a brilliant conceit, intricate and fascinating in what it says about the unknowability of truth and how the practice of mythologising is basically a Hydra of endlessly multiplying theories
 JonBenét herself is the least present character here, and whether that is an appropriate omission – whether it feels like a respectfully empty seat at the table or a hole where the film's painful heart should be – is debatable
 Casting JonBenét is many things: funny, provocative, clever, audacious, maybe even dazzling like a Vaseline-smeared, white-toothed pageant smile
 But it is not sad, and perhaps it should be, just a little
“For some countries in Asia, where there have been repressive regimes and no freedom of speech, the past has often gone unquestioned and unexplored,” says Linda Kennedy in this video exploring how art has become memory for many of those showing at Art Basel Hong Kong
Kennedy reports from this year’s event, looking at the ways in which sculpture, installation work and painting represent different forms of remembering
 With a kind of archaeology of the present, one artist presents found objects from his hometown as though they were ancient, and no past existed before the city’s industrialisation
Another, a cascading image showing the boat refugee crisis in the Mediterranean, has been stretched out beyond recognition by a Vietnamese artist who himself sought refuge by boat in the 1970s
 “The work poses a question,” says Kennedy
 “How will we remember these tragedies
”
She discusses what has happened to political art in Asia with curator Caroline Ha Thuc and asks Art Basel’s Asia director Adeline Ooi whether art looking at the past is somehow safer and easier to sell than dissident art
 “There’s always something new to learn about volcanoes,” says David Pyle, professor of earth sciences at the University of Oxford
 “Around 600 volcanoes have erupted within the last 200 years, and 1,500 could erupt again within the next few decades
” He smiles
 “But we are never clever enough to work out what volcanoes will do next
 The deadliest eruptions have always been of quiet volcanoes
”
Despite the best efforts of modern science, massive eruptions can still result in catastrophic loss of life
 Since 1900, the two worst volcanic events were the eruption of Mount Pelée on the Caribbean island of Martinique, on 8 May 1902, which destroyed the city of Saint-Pierre, killing 28,000 people; and the eruption, in 1985, of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, which melted the mountain’s glaciers, causing mudflows to race down the volcano’s side and engulf the town of Armero, where more than 20,000 people died
(Credit: Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford)
The earliest known sketch of a volcano dates back to the 15th Century, from the German manuscript of The Voyage of Saint Brendan (Credit: Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford)
Of course, it isn’t only volcanologists who are concerned with large eruptions
 Volcanoes, an ongoing exhibition organised by Pyle at Oxford’s Bodleian Libraries, reminds us that devastating eruptions – Vesuvius in AD 79, Tambora in 1815, Krakatoa in 1883 – have often fascinated humans, filling them with awe and dread
 For millennia, artists and writers, as well as scientists, have felt compelled to depict and describe volcanoes
    The earliest known sketch of a volcano comes from an early 15th-Century German manuscript 
The Bodleian’s show consists mostly of written and printed material from its collections, including letters, woodcuts, and engravings
 It contains the earliest known sketch of a volcano, from the margins of an early-15th-century German manuscript of The Voyage of Saint Brendan – a Christian story about an Irish monk who sailed the Atlantic searching for paradise
 Supposedly, Brendan encountered volcanic islands including one with “flames shooting up into the sky… so that the mountain seemed a burning pyre”
There is also a beautiful map of Iceland’s volcanoes from a 1606 edition of Flemish map-maker Abraham Ortelius’s Theatre of the World, which is often described as the first modern atlas
 Alongside fantastical sea monsters and delightful, tiny polar bears cavorting atop ice floes in the Arctic Ocean, the map depicts volcanoes including Hekla, once considered the gateway to chaos, and the glacier Eyjafjallajökull, which – four centuries later – erupted in April 2010, producing an enormous cloud of smoke and ash that blew across northern Europe, disrupting air travel for weeks
Nearby, we find a fragment of an incinerated papyrus scroll from the ancient Roman town of Herculaneum, which was buried during the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius, and a 15th-Century manuscript of the Letters of Pliny the Younger, who provided an eyewitness account of the eruption
 Indeed, Pliny’s account was so accurate – recording, for instance, that the initial sign of the eruption was an unusual cloud, in the shape of a pine tree, rising from the mountain’s summit – that volcanologists still categorise this type of violently explosive eruption as 'Plinian'
The gates of hell
According to the writer and cultural historian James Hamilton – who, in 2010, curated a brilliant exhibition of art inspired by volcanoes at Compton Verney in Warwickshire – Mount Vesuvius, on the Gulf of Naples, has had a greater impact upon Western culture than any other volcano
 Principally, this was due to the discovery, during the 18th Century, of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, which were both obliterated by deadly pyroclastic surges and ash clouds during the eruption in AD 79

“The area rapidly became a magnet for tourism,” Pyle explains
 “And many wealthy tourists on the Grand Tour became obsessed with Naples and Vesuvius
 When they got back, they wanted to show fabulous depictions of the fabled vista of the Bay of Naples in their country houses
”
In antiquity, the region’s volcanic landscape was associated with hell: in Book VI of Virgil’s Aeneid, for instance, Aeneas descends to the underworld via a cave near Lake Avernus, a volcanic crater lake not far from the volcanic Phlegraean (‘Flaming’) Fields, situated to the west of Naples
 “In some Icelandic tales, Hekla is imagined in a similar way,” Pyle says
    Artists like JMW Turner travelled to Naples in the hope of witnessing Vesuvius in action 
By the 18th Century, though, people were beginning to be interested in Italy’s Campanian volcanic arc for scientific reasons
 The 18th-Century diplomat William Hamilton, for instance, who was Britain’s ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples between 1764 and 1800, was obsessed with Vesuvius
He rented a villa at the foot of the cone-shaped mountain, and monitored a cycle of significant eruptions during the 1760s and ’70s, sending informed letters detailing his observations to the Royal Society in London
 Between 1776 and 1779, these were published as Campi Phlegraei (“Fields of Fire”) – described by Pyle as “one of the first descriptive monographs of an active volcano”
 It remains remarkable for the vivid nature of its influential illustrations by the English-born artist Pietro Fabris
Out of the ashes
The prospect of witnessing the spectacle of Vesuvius erupting lured many travellers, including artists such as Joseph Wright of Derby
 In 1774, Wright stayed with Hamilton for a month – writing to his brother that “there was a very considerable eruption at the time – tis the most wonderful sight in nature”
 During his lifetime, he painted more than 30 views of the exploding volcano
 “The heyday of the visual art around volcanoes was the mid to late 1700s,” Pyle says
The painter JMW Turner also visited Naples, in 1819, four years after he had exhibited at the Royal Academy a striking and dramatic canvas titled The Eruption of the Souffrier Mountains, in the Island of St Vincent, at Midnight, on the 30th of April, 1812, from a Sketch Taken at the Time by Hugh P Keane, Esq
 “This was painted not from Turner’s own observation, but, as the title indicates, from a sketch by the barrister and sugar plantation owner Hugh Perry Keane,” explains James Hamilton, in a short book published to accompany the Compton Verney show
 Sadly, for Turner in 1819, his hopes of witnessing an erupting volcano for himself came to naught
 While he was in the area, Vesuvius produced nothing but a few wisps of smoke and ash

Countless other artists have represented volcanoes
 During the 19th Century, the Japanese artists Hokusai and Hiroshige both made woodblock prints featuring landscape views of the active stratovolcano Mount Fuji
 In 1874, John Ruskin painted Etna from Taormina, on Sicily
 Even Andy Warhol, in 1985, produced a series of large, luridly coloured canvases of Vesuvius erupting
 “I painted each Vesuvius by hand,” he said, “always using different colours so that they can give the impression of having been painted just one minute after the eruption
”
Cartoonists, too, have often been drawn to volcanoes: in 1815, for instance, on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, George Cruikshank produced a political cartoon in which Vesuvius was seen ejecting the deposed King of Naples and his wife Caroline, Napoleon’s sister
 In 2010, the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull inspired a satirical cartoon by Gerald Scarfe commenting upon the campaign for a British general election
    The power of a volcano is unlike anything you can experience elsewhere on Earth – David Pyle 
Volcanoes have also proved attractive for writers
 “The first global volcanic eruption, in terms of global news coverage, was the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883,” says Pyle
 “The transatlantic telegraph network had just been completed, and so the story of that eruption was told within hours in northern Europe
 Immediately, Krakatoa made it into novels
 RM Ballantyne published a book called Blown to Bits, a few years later, built around the testimonies of people who had survived the eruption
”

Filmmakers, too, have found volcanoes irresistible
 The Bodleian’s exhibition contains two film posters: one for the Italian drama Volcano (1950), and another for Roberto Rossellini’s neo-realist Stromboli, from the same year, starring Ingrid Bergman
 There are also lots of examples of volcano-inspired ephemera and merchandise, including ‘Vulcan’ matchboxes
The answer may seem obvious, but why, exactly, do volcanoes exert such a hold upon our collective imagination
 “There’s something visceral about peering into an abyss,” explains Pyle
 “Standing on the side of a volcano, you can hear it rumble and feel it shake
 People have used the same words to describe volcanoes for millennia
 They offer this feeling of an awesome power that’s unlike anything you can experience elsewhere on Earth

 One day in January 1964, when he was still only 26 years old, David Hockney, the Wunderkind of post-war British painting, found himself sitting on a beach in California
 It was 24C (76F) and he couldn’t believe his luck
 Revelling in the sun and sand, he decided to send a postcard to his friend and dealer, John Kasmin, in chilly, grey-skied Britain
“Arrived in the promised land 2 days ago,” he wrote on the back of a card that reproduced the slogan “Greetings from California ‘Playground of the Nation’”, as well as enticing images of fresh oranges and a Pacific beach swarming with bronzed sun-worshippers
 “The world’s most beautiful city is here – LA… You must come
”

“California, for Hockney, was everything that England wasn’t,” explains Andrew Wilson, co-curator of Tate Britain’s new retrospective of the artist’s work
 The most extensive overview of Hockney’s career to date, it will then travel to the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
 “California was a place of fantasy for him,” Wilson continues, “and he found a way to live it
 He still loves the high-keyed colours, the light, the sensuousness and sexiness of California
”
By 1964, Hockney had been in love with Los Angeles – or, rather, the intoxicating idea of it – for a long time
 Growing up in Bradford in Yorkshire, the fourth of five children in what he called “a radical working-class family”, he was bewitched by the flickering spell of cinema, which offered escape from his humdrum surroundings
 And the ‘Dream Factory’ of Hollywood was, of course, the centre of America’s film industry
    Hockney recognised that LA was uncharted territory that he could conquer as a painter 
Moreover, as a gay man, Hockney was a fan of the cult magazine Physique Pictorial, which was also produced in Los Angeles
 As a student at London’s Royal College of Art (RCA), he used this beefcake magazine as a source for paintings – and he continued to plunder it for imagery throughout the 1960s
 Domestic Scene, Los Angeles (1963), for instance, which Hockney painted before he’d visited the city, was based on a picture from the magazine

So, when, in 1963, a year after he had graduated from the RCA with a gold medal, Hockney’s first solo exhibition at Kasmin’s gallery sold out, he decided to spend some of his earnings on a trip to the US
 And top of his list of destinations was the ‘promised land’ of California – in particular, LA
“I instinctively knew I was going to like it,” he recalled later
 “And as I flew over San Bernardino and saw the swimming pools and the houses and everything and the sun, I was more thrilled than I have ever been in arriving in any city
”
Making a splash
Almost immediately, Hockney – who, arguably, has done more than any artist to fashion LA’s visual identity – sensed an opportunity: he recognised that the city was uncharted territory that he could conquer as a painter
“There were no paintings of Los Angeles,” he once explained
 “People then didn’t even know what it looked like
 And when I was there, they were still finishing up some of the freeways
 I remember seeing, within the first week, a ramp of freeway going into the air, and I suddenly thought: ‘My God, this place needs its Piranesi [the 18th-Century Italian artist who executed countless views of Rome]; Los Angeles could have a Piranesi, so here I am
”
A Bigger Splash

Of course, Hockney’s most famous paintings of Los Angeles don’t depict freeways at all, but rather another commonplace aspect of the city, which became his greatest subject: private swimming pools
To a young artist who had grown up in Britain during World War Two, experiencing deprivation and the austerities of rationing, LA’s swimming pools must have seemed almost impossibly luxurious and exotic
 “The swimming pool,” says Wilson, “quickly became his sign for California
”
The first pool painting that Hockney made was California Art Collector (1964)
 Inspired by visits to the chic homes of collectors on the West Coast, it depicts a fashionable woman in her garden, beside an ancient carving and a sculpture by William Turnbull
 Above her is a canopy that Hockney modelled upon a structure in Piero della Francesca’s Nativity (1470-75), in the National Gallery in London
At first glance, the canopy looks like a piece of glass-walled modern architecture – and this, I suspect, was deliberate: Hockney surely wanted to tweak Francis Bacon’s notoriously doom-laden pictures, with their screaming figures imprisoned in glass boxes
 Darkness and angst is, here, dispelled by sparkling Californian sunshine – rendered, by Hockney, in vivid, fresh acrylics
 Optimism has replaced despair
Peter Getting out of Nick’s Pool

And, there, in the background, as if promising to lead us up to heaven, a fantastical rainbow arches in the direction of a distant swimming pool, overshadowed by palm trees
 Hockney based it upon an advertisement for swimming pools that he had spotted in the Los Angeles Times
Before long, of course, swimming pools had ventured from a corner of Hockney’s vision to occupy centre stage
 After returning to the UK later that year, he completed Picture of a Hollywood Swimming Pool, from a drawing
 In 1965, he was back in LA, and as he spent more time there, during the second half of the ‘60s (eventually, in 1978, he decided to make the city his permanent home), so swimming pools began to feature more prominently in his work, in paintings such as Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool (1966), Sunbather (1966), and, most famously of all, A Bigger Splash (1967) – the last of a sequence of three paintings on the same theme
    Swimming pools represent hedonism, sexual freedom, and joie de vivre 
While Hockney’s most iconic pool paintings date from the ‘60s and early ‘70s – Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), for instance, was painted in 1972 – Wilson points out that, in fact, he never left the subject entirely behind
 A series of semi-abstract paper-pulp paintings, known as the Paper Pools, dates from the late Seventies
 Tate’s exhibition, meanwhile, features Gregory Swimming, Los Angeles, March 31st 1982, one of Hockney’s composite photographic works, consisting of 120 Polaroids arranged in a rectangular grid
Garden 2015

Moreover, the last room of the show contains recent paintings by Hockney of his garden in LA
 “And,” says Wilson, “one of the main features of his garden is the swimming pool
 So, you could say that painting swimming pools spans the whole of his career, since his arrival in LA in ’64
”
Hidden depths
One of the most striking things about Hockney’s pool paintings is the way in which, consistently, they stand apart from the dominant tradition, in other art forms, of depicting Los Angeles in a sinister fashion (think of, say, Raymond Chandler’s literary noir, or Roman Polanski’s 1974 thriller, Chinatown)
 Swimming pools, in Hockney’s world, represent hedonism, sexual freedom, and straightforward joie de vivre
“To Hockney, LA wasn’t a seedy, gritty, dark, noir-ish place,” says Wilson
 “It was a world of plenty that was absolutely ‘other’ to the world he knew in London or Bradford
 When he wrote that postcard to Kasmin, about the ‘promised land’, he wasn’t being ironic
”
Bathers
Bathers were an important subject for 19th and 20th Century artists, from Renoir and Seurat (whose Bathers at Asnières is shown here) to Cezanne and Matisse (Credit: Alamy)
Of course, in the ‘60s, painting swimming pools also allowed Hockney to depict beautiful, semi-naked young men
 Arguably, these pool paintings should be understood as an extension of his early work, which he once characterised as “homosexual propaganda” (homosexuality remained illegal in Britain until 1967)
After all, as any fan of modern art will know, bathers were an important subject for 19th and 20th Century artists, from Renoir and Seurat to Cezanne and Matisse
 Hockney, in his pool paintings, offered a queer take on this canonical (and heterosexual) tradition
“The pool paintings are very much about desire,” Wilson says
 “And Hockney has a strong awareness of art history, certainly back to Cezanne; back, even, to Botticelli’s Birth of Venus
 So, queering that kind of subject matter is what these paintings are about
”

In addition, the pool pictures provided Hockney with a forum in which he could explore technical, formalist concerns – and even engage in dialogue with contemporary abstraction
“The paintings,” Wilson explains, “are about how you represent the immaterial: water and light, transparency, different kinds of liquidities
 And they are interested in the conventions of picture-making
 The way Hockney paints water in his swimming pools employs abstract strategies, like [those in] paintings by Bernard Cohen, Jean Dubuffet, or Helen Frankenthaler
 He uses [abstract] techniques to paint something as impossible to fix as light on water or the passage of bodies underwater
”
Wilson is adamant that anyone who dismisses Hockney’s pool paintings as superficial is making a mistake
 “There is a feeling: how can Hockney be a ‘serious’ artist, when all he paints are swimming pools
 I don’t agree with that at all
 In the same way, you could say that large swathes of Matisse’s output are superficial
” (Matisse, incidentally, created his own important pool picture: a late paper cut-out called The Swimming Pool (1952), depicting a frieze of frolicking female swimmers, which took form on the walls of his dining room in Nice
)
Wilson pauses
 “Actually, I think Hockney is making incredibly profound paintings
 Yes, he is painting LA, a land of surfaces
 But he’s interested in surfaces being penetrated – light penetrating glass, penetrating water – and he’s fascinated with how you picture that in an emotional and feeling way
 These aren’t cold-hearted paintings, by any stretch of the imagination
 They’re about humanity
 And that’s why they connect with people

Bookworms feel about the Brontës much the way that music buffs feel about The Beatles
 You’re either a Charlotte devotee or an Emily enthusiast
 Or maybe, just maybe, you’re a fan of Anne
 Even so, the idea of these country parson’s daughters leaving behind such indelible novels of gothic passion and wild romanticism is compelling enough that it’s impossible not to think of them as a single unit, like some literary girl band
 For all their differences they remain, quite simply, the Brontës
With three larger-than-life sisters (even Anne’s relative obscurity seems writ extra large), it’s little wonder that the fourth Bronte, their brother Branwell, often gets forgotten
 This festive season, a one-off drama by multi-BAFTA award winner Sally Wainwright has restored him to the family portrait
 And what a portrait it is

Branwell Brontë painted this portrait of himself with his sisters – but later attempted to erase himself from the picture

“We wove a web in childhood, a web of sunny air,” utters the voice of Finn Atkins’ Charlotte at the start of To Walk Invisible
 She’s quoting from her character’s 1835 poem about creativity, innocence and mortality, and its incantatory lines are accompanied by mesmerising images: the Brontë brood are still children, clutching toy soldiers and immersed in their make-believe world of Angria and Gondal
 Around their heads flicker wreathes of amber flames, signifying the fervour of their imaginations
    At the very moment when his sisters’ dreams were acquiring substance, Branwell was sinking into alcoholism and drug addiction 
From these opening moments on, the film sets out to reclaim the Brontës from the tide of twee that has posthumously engulfed them – think ‘Which Bronte are you
’ quizzes and cosy merchandising (Brontë oven mitts, anyone
)
 By the time the credits roll, their fierceness and the force of their ambition has been restored to them, along with their individuality and with it, their rivalries
Branwell is his sisters’ equal to start with, but the film is set primarily during the final three years of his short life, and he cuts a squalid, self-pitying figure for much of it
 At the very moment when his sisters’ dreams were acquiring substance (1847 saw the publication of Charlotte’s Jane Eyre, Emily’s Wuthering Heights and Anne’s Agnes Grey), Branwell was sinking into alcoholism and drug addiction
 And while they were battling to circumvent the sexism of the age, publishing under male pseudonyms, he pinned his hopes for artistic freedom on marrying into a life of leisure
 Inevitably, his relationship with his sisters – and theirs with each other – became increasingly challenging
Family affairs
Hovering in the film’s background is their clever, unusual father, who propelled himself from hardscrabble Ireland to Cambridge University
 He carried a loaded pistol with him at all times and yet instilled a passion for literature in his daughters as well as his son
 Patrick Brontë was born in County Down in 1777
 He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1806 and met and married middle class Maria Branwell six years later (“my saucy Pat” she calls him in a surviving love letter)
 A spirited Cornish native, Maria died less than a decade later, having borne six children, five of them in as many years
 By then, the family had moved to Haworth, a village on the edge of the Yorkshire Moors

Charlotte, the eldest surviving child, was five when she lost her mother, Branwell was four, Emily three, and Anne not yet two
 It’s no surprise that, again and again, mothers are lost young in the sisters’ fiction
 Two years later, in 1825, their two elder sisters, Maria and Elizabeth, died within six weeks of one another from tuberculosis contracted while away at school
Options were limited for a modestly salaried man seeking to educate his daughters, and Charlotte and Emily also boarded at the Clergy Daughters’ School at Cowan Bridge, but it was a harsh place, the inspiration for Jane Eyre’s grim Lowood, where a young Jane goes cold and hungry and falls in with a much-abused classmate named Helen Burns, who was based on Charlotte’s lost sister Maria
    The steaminess of Charlotte’s letters countered the saintly image that she was intent on portraying 
The four surviving Brontë children were thrown together back at Haworth, where their widowed father imposed some eccentric rules, like not allowing them to eat meat lest it make them soft
 An aunt had come to live with them after their mother’s death, but they were left largely to their own devices, with plenty of time to pursue elaborate role-playing games featuring figures from military history such as the Duke of Wellington and Napoleon
“The sisters never really seem to have thought about getting married,” notes biographer Claire Harman, whose Charlotte Brontë: A Life was published in 2015
 “They all were very interested in battles and statistics and geography – things that girls weren’t traditionally encouraged to think about
 They were horribly oppressed by the idea of having to work but at no point did they think ‘I have to be a governess, but hey, I might get married’
”
The boring Brontë
It was Charlotte’s experience as a governess in Brussels, in a school run by Constantin Heger and his wife, that would sharpen her creative desires
 Charlotte developed feelings for Monsieur Heger – feelings that were not reciprocated – and she wanted to be read by him
 From Haworth, she wrote him four long letters, which Heger tore up only for his wife to fish out of the bin and piece them back together
 These letters were initially hushed up by Charlotte’s friend (the anachronistic term ‘frenemy’ might be more apt) and biographer, Mrs Gaskell
 Their steaminess countered the saintly image of Charlotte that she was intent on portraying
 For Harman, however, they tell a vivid story of human nature and female experience
 As she puts it, they’re “fuelled by hormones, eroticism, youthful anger and all sorts of amazing stuff”
Scholars have often questioned whether Anne would have been published had it not been for her famous siblings
 According to Harman, the same could be asked of Emily
 “She clearly is a genius but I think she was very controlling, probably slightly autistic
 Wuthering Heights is such a strange book, full of violence and peculiarity
 People say it’s their favourite romantic novel but it’s hardly a model for romantic love; there’s a load of anger and energy, and people get thumped across rooms all the time
 Whether that book would ever have been published – or finished – is really doubtful if they hadn’t all been together
(Credit: Alamy)

“What appeals to me about them as a group is the intensity with which they lived and wrote, and also how it could so very, very easily not have got out into the published world and into posterity’s grasp,” Harman says
And yet that unity hasn’t always been beneficial
 “Lumping them all together irons out their complexities,” says author and playwright Samantha Ellis
 It’s particularly hurt Anne, the subject of her new book, Take Courage: Anne Bronte and the Art of Life (its title is taken from Anne’s last words)
    It’s wrong to dismiss Anne as ‘the boring Brontë’ – Samantha Ellis 
Ellis admits that she’d always dismissed Anne as “the boring Brontë”
 That changed when she was offered the chance to don latex gloves and examine some relics at the Brontë Parsonage Museum
 She was excited to see Charlotte’s minuscule books and Emily’s raging sketches, but Anne’s final letter didn’t much interest her – until she started reading it
“I’d believed Charlotte when she said Anne was gloomy, less talented than her sisters and spent her whole life preparing for an early death
 But in the letter, Anne seemed completely different: clever, bold, and wanting more life
 I started to wonder why she’d been neglected, and had a hunch it might be because she was just too radical
“I certainly don’t think she’s boring or untalented or gloomy any more
 I think she was the most radical
 I also had to face the fact that one of the main reasons she has been neglected is because her sister Charlotte actively suppressed her best book, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall
”

“They have such varied temperaments,” notes Claire Harman
 “It’s a fascinating laboratory experiment – you get this DNA, you stick it in these bizarre conditions, and out come these totally different but clearly very closely related classic novelists
” For Ellis, the resulting friction between them was a source of inspiration and helped them define themselves
 “They were [probably] the best writers’ group that ever was
”
Branwell was a key part of that group, and you need only consider the heroes and antiheroes in Charlotte, Emily and Anne’s novels to see how Branwell’s unravelling and their particular responses to it found its way into their work
 His self-destructive end provides much of To Walk Invisible’s drama, and yet even here, his sturm und drang is eclipsed by his sisters’ accomplishments
 Ultimately, that is just as it should be
An almost palpable fug of sour alcohol rises from the wild-bearded, unkempt man sleeping in the backseat of a battered limo
 At a sharp clunk caused by the gang members trying to steal his rims, his rheumy, bloodshot eyes spring open and Logan, aka Wolverine, aka James Howlett, aka, for the last 17 years, Hugh Jackman, utters his first word in James Mangold's new X-Men spinoff
 It’s unprintable here
 But the four-letter word is a red herring
 If you think that salty language will be Mangold's primary means of testing the permissive limits of the film's for-adults-only R-rating, in the very next moments he dispatches multiple sneering gang members via the maximally gory means of blading them through the head in gouging, spurting detail
    Logan expects us to take it seriously – and we actually can
As the last of them slides off his adamantium claws to the ground, we're not even halfway through the opening titles
 This is Mangold declaring that not only will his film stand apart from his last time at the helm with 2013's The Wolverine, it will be different from all the Marvel movies that have gone before – if not from superhero films in general
 It will be different even from Deadpool, the foul-mouthed hit of 2016, because there's no quip, no wink to camera, no meta flourish to let us know that this is all just a bit of malarkey
 Determinedly dark, defiantly grimy and really quite depressing, Logan is pointedly devoid of humour, and expects us to take it seriously
 The surprise is that, for the most part, we actually can
For genre purists, it can be disconcerting to see comic book movies classified as sci-fi
 And though the X-Men franchise, being about genetic mutation, has maybe more of a claim to that designation than, say, Thor, the outsize arcs and simplistic good vs evil binaries of the superhero film do not often lend themselves to the thoughtful curiosity that is a hallmark of the best science fiction
 It would be overstating it to say that Logan reaches sci-fi heights – there's a standard-issue British Evil Scientist (played with pale-eyed zeal by Richard E Grant), a henchman with a Terminator arm (Boyd Holbrook, good value in a relatively small role) and an albino mutant (Stephen Merchant in a rare and surprisingly decent dramatic performance) whose photosensitivity is so extreme he'll burst into flames in sunlight like Nosferatu
 So, you know, this is not Tarkovsky's Solaris
    The father-daughter mutant duo who slay together stay together
But Logan does go defiantly against the grain by favouring melancholic mood and themes of mortality and deterioration over inflated, end-of-the-world stakes or grandiose action pyrotechnics
 That said, the fight scenes are extremely gruesome, especially when half the time it's a child doing the slicing and dicing
The X factor
According to the plot it is 2029 and no new mutant has been born for many years
 A broken-down and alcoholic Logan is scraping a living as a limo driver and caring for a deteriorating Professor X (Patrick Stewart), whose degenerative disease renders his "weapon of mass destruction" brain  potentially large-scale lethal unless he remains under heavy sedation
 Logan is approached by a woman who begs him to take her and her daughter Laura to North Dakota, but there are mercenaries attached to a genetic research corporation, led by Pierce (Holbrook), on their trail
 Laura is in fact a mutant, built in a lab, and the nature of her mutation suggests that Wolverine's DNA was the key ingredient
 So despite an almost pathological reluctance to get involved, Wolverine is drawn into the role of protector, in a manner that the screenplay, co-written by Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green, keeps from getting overly sentimental, while still providing the film with what little emotional uplift it has
 The father/daughter mutant duo who slay together, stay together, after all
    Logan’s darkness is not simply an aesthetic filter as in Batman v Superman
Logan’s darkness is not simply an aesthetic filter as was the case in Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; it emanates from within the character
 It's ironic that the title shares some DNA with the famously campy 1970s sci-fi film, Logan’s Run, in which people are considered obsolete at 30 and murdered
 In its way, Logan is just as much about the pitilessness of the aging process, and Jackman's battle-scarred, stiffening body is as expressive in this regard as his perma-scowl of a face
 It's taking him longer to heal, his eyes are never clear and one of his claws won't fully extend
 This makes him less Logan's Run, more Logan's Limp
 He's as battered a superhero as we've ever seen, and for the first time his body bears exterior witness to the inner torture that has always defined him
 His body is the story
There are flaws, of course
 At 135 minutes the film is unnecessarily long, especially when one lengthy digression in the middle feels so inorganic
 And considering the relentless dourness, and the serially downbeat turns the story takes, it does pose the questions: How bleak is too bleak
 How many head stabbings are too many head stabbings
 How standalone can a film be, and still relate to the continuity of a wider cinematic universe
 How much doom-laden mortality can a film portray and still be a superhero movie
In an era of cinematic product homogenisation there’s no doubt that Logan is a risky proposition
 But this is reportedly Jackman’s last time donning those claws and chewing on that cigar
 Considering it was his Wolverine, as the centrepiece of Bryan Singer’s X-Men (2000), who launched the currently omnipresent superhero phenomenon in the first place, maybe the most appropriate thing would be that, with the brutal, melancholic elegy that is Logan, Wolverine remakes the superhero movie again, this time as a farewell
“The kiss itself is immortal
 It travels from lip to lip, century to century, from age to age,” wrote Guy de Maupassant
 The image of two lovers embracing is the epitome of romantic love, seen in great works of art and iconic photographs from throughout history, but the simple act of affection can have far greater power than many realise
 For Valentine’s Day, we looked back into the BBC Culture archive at some of our most popular stories about the kiss, from Gustav Klimt’s shimmering masterpiece to a politically-charged mural that features Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin

Klimt’s most famous work, The Kiss, has dazzled art lovers for over a century
 Regarded as the highlight of his ‘Golden Period’, many look at the painting and see romance, but for some The Kiss represents a much darker vision – particularly when placed in its historical context
Art’s other famous kiss, the sculpture by Auguste Rodin, is also open to alternative readings
 Seen as a “universal representation of sexual infatuation”, it has a dark and complicated origins
 Did you know that Rodin’s lovers actually represent a pair of doomed adulterers from Dante’s Inferno
 And despite the sinister inspiration behind it, Rodin didn’t consider The Kiss to be provocative – or particularly interesting, dismissing it as “a large sculpted knick-knack following the usual formula”

A kiss can also still have shock value, from popstars locking lips on stage at award ceremonies to political figures being depicted in an embrace on murals around the world
 Last May, a street artist went viral after imagining a passionate embrace between Donald Trump, then a frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, and Russian leader Vladimir Putin
Another kiss made headlines in 2016, and called to mind the work of Bansky, when two police officers got engaged during London’s annual gay pride parade
 The image went viral at a moment when the news was dominated by growing intolerance towards minority groups – and just two weeks after the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando
 Its political power was heightened by worldwide events, but it also showed how far society, particularly in Britain, has changed over the last decade

If you needed any more evidence of the power of a kiss, you only need to look to Star Trek
 The sci-fi franchise was actually the first to feature an interracial kiss on US television, back in 1968
 Star Trek’s creator, Gene Roddenberry, wanted audiences to know that by the 23rd Century tolerance is the norm
 “All science fiction is telling two stories: about the world in which it is set and the world in which it is written
 And the burdens of 20th-Century America lie heavily in the Star Trek universe,” wrote Natalie Haynes in her July 2016 story, which marked Star Trek’s 50th anniversary
In the early 20th Century, Percy Fawcett travelled deep into the Amazon jungle on a quest to find a rumoured city of gold and maize
 Seeing this life-long obsession play out would be reason enough to watch writer-director James Gray’s dynamic The Lost City of Z
 But the film sets itself apart from the average adventure saga by assuming a pointed cultural perspective
Gray places Fawcett in the context of the British age of exploration and empire, complete with assumptions about the so-called ‘primitive’ people of the Amazon and a huge dose of snobbery at home
 Early in the film, Fawcett, an army major, is denied a dinner invitation because, as one member of the upper echelon says, “He has been rather unfortunate in his choice of ancestors
”
    Lost City entrances and allures rather than grabs you by the throat 
Sneering at such imperious assumptions is easy today
 The mastery of Gray’s film, and of Charlie Hunnam’s subtle yet magnetic performance as Fawcett, is that they immerse viewers in the past, allowing the audience to appreciate the most radical aspect of Fawcett’s real-life journey: he goes from being a victim of his era to a man at its cultural forefront
The film begins by displaying the elaborate trappings of the society that does not quite accept Fawcett
 There is an action-packed fox hunt and a grand ball, and in between a lovely, intimate conversation between Fawcett and his wife, Nina (in an elegant and natural performance by Sienna Miller)
 He nicknames her Cheeky, and confides to her his sense of fleeting years and of failure
Those early scenes establish both his character and the film’s deliberate pace
 Even in the most dramatic jungle moments, Lost City works by entrancing and alluring viewers rather than grabbing them by the throat
 Anyone who found Gray’s previous film, The Immigrant, too slow may feel the same about Lost City, but those who settle into its rhythm will be rewarded with a rich exploration into the mind of an Edwardian adventurer
    This is not the tale of two heartthrobs in the jungle; Hunnam handles that on his own 
When the Royal Geographical Society asks Fawcett to go to Bolivia to chart the border with Brazil, he takes on the dangerous assignment because it offers a chance to redeem the family name that his alcoholic gambler of a father had sullied
 He leaves behind the pregnant Nina, who understands that the sacrifice will be for the family’s long-term good
Voyage of discovery
For that first expedition in 1906, Robert Pattinson arrives as Fawcett’s taciturn, loyal aide-de-camp, Henry Costin
 Pattinson looks shabby, with a scraggly beard and wire-rimmed glasses
 (This is not the tale of two heartthrobs in the jungle; Hunnam handles that on his own
) His character is flat, but he is part of the grand action the men face as an indigenous South American guides them in canoes and on rafts toward the source of the Rio Verde
 They brave the blistering sun, and dodge arrows shot from riverbanks
 In one act of desperation and wit, Fawcett disarms attacking Indians by having his British colleagues join him in singing Soldiers of the Queen
 He also hears of the lost city, and finds shards of ancient pottery that suggest an advanced civilization
Fawcett may be obsessed with the city he calls Zed, but he does not turn into a lunatic or megalomaniac, as more familiar movie explorers have (think of Kurtz in Apocalypse Now or the title character in Aguirre the Wrath of God)
 Even in the Amazon, Fawcett is constantly missing his wife and children
 And when he gives a speech to the Royal Geographical Society on his return, holding up his shard of pottery, the scene reveals how dramatically his mind has been opened
 He is jeered when he suggests that a South American civilisation might pre-date Britain’s, and accuses his dismissive colleagues of being “steeped in the bigotry of the church
"
    This is no jewel-coloured fantasy 
He and Costin take up the quest again, in a trip cut short by a greedy amateur who tags along
 They return just in time for World War One
 Fawcett, by then nearing middle age, fights heroically at the Somme
 Gray handles the battle scenes, and all his big set pieces, with calm expertise
 His earlier works, including We Own the Night and The Yards, were gritty contemporary gangster movies
 Lost City continues the epic historical ambition of The Immigrant, in which Marion Cotillard played a Polish woman forced into prostitution in early 20th Century New York
Inward journey
Along with cinematographer Darius Khondji, Gray creates a subdued look for Lost City
 Each scene is gracefully composed, yet a brown haze covers the scenes set in Europe, and the green of the jungle is toned-down
 This is no jewel-coloured fantasy
 The Bolivian scenes, shot in Colombia, are created with such immediacy that viewers may feel the urge to swat insects away
At times Gray shoots Hunnam in glamorous, shadowy, matinee-idol profile
 But Hunnam, best known as a biker in the series Sons of Anarchy, proves himself an actor of genuine depth
 He captures Fawcett’s many emotional layers, as he grapples with the competing forces of ambition and responsibility
In 1925, Fawcett’s oldest son, Jack (Tom Holland, playing with a mix of determination and innocence) joins him in one more search for Z
 By then they have competition
 “The Americans will venture there with their guns, and then we must pray they do not destroy the Indians,” Jack tells his father
 Such lines, like some of Nina’s proto-feminist remarks, are a bit too blunt to work as dialogue, but they are scarce
In real life, Fawcett and Jack disappeared during their trip, their fates never determined
 David Grann’s best-selling book, on which the movie is based, posits a likely solution to the mysteries of the disappearance and of Z
 Gray’s ending is more ambiguous and the film’s stunning final shot is beautifully imagined
Gray’s own imaginative journey into Fawcett’s character shapes this quietly eloquent film
 Although Fawcett was forward-thinking about the Indians, to the end he retained the certainty and righteousness of the Kipling-reading man who had set off on an adventure decades before
 “Be brave,” he tells his son when they are surrounded by members of a hostile tribe
 “Nothing will happen to us that is not our destiny

“It’s in the singing of a street-corner choir,” sing the Muppets in their peerless adaptation of Charles Dickens, The Muppet Christmas Carol
 “It’s going home and getting warm by the fire
 It’s true, wherever you find love it feels like Christmas
” And for many of us, Christmas films are as much a part of the psychological and emotional preparation for the season as mince pies and mulled wine
Making the perfect Christmas movie is a tough proposition: get it right, and you become part of your audience’s festive rituals for years to come
 Get it wrong, and you have 2014’s Saving Christmas, the IMDb entry for which reveals a score of 1
5 out of 10, after an internet campaign to create the lowest possible rating in the database
 At the time of writing, it doesn’t even have that accolade: it’s slipped into second-from-last place
    Christmas films are all about desire, though rarely in its erotic sense
The intricacies of a Christmas film are more complex than they might first appear
 It isn’t necessary or sufficient to set a film at Christmas
 Virtually every Shane Black film, from The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) to The Nice Guys (2016) is set at or near Christmas, but we don’t tend to think of them as Christmas films
 Black has described his obsession with the festive season by referencing Three Days of the Condor, “the Sydney Pollack film, where Christmas in the background adds this really odd, chilling counterpoint to the espionage plot
” But for a film to achieve classic Christmas movie status, Christmas needs to be more than the counterpoint
 It must be the focus
Christmas films are all about desire, though rarely in its erotic sense (Love, Actually is the best-known exception to this rule)
 Think of the scene at the start of A Christmas Story, where Ralphie gazes through the shop window at his longed-for BB gun
 The film was made almost 40 years after the Cary Grant classic, The Bishop’s Wife, which has Loretta Young gazing with equal fervour at a beautiful hat
    The sense of longing for something which cannot love you back is intrinsic to this time of year
Just as Ralphie fears he may never receive the BB gun (since every adult he knows, from his parents to the department store Santa Claus, think he will shoot his eye out with it),  Julia also doesn’t imagine that she will ever own the glorious hat
 The object of desire itself is less important than the yearning it instils in both character and viewer
 Even if the gun and the hat aren’t quite what you had in mind for yourself this Christmas, the sense of longing for something which cannot love you back is intrinsic to this time of year: Christmas advertising depends upon it
Grinches and gunshots
There is often a touch of magic in the best Christmas films, whether it is a quasi-religious miracle, or something a little more pagan
 In The Bishop’s Wife Dudley may be an angel on an earthly mission to help David Niven’s Bishop Henry Brougham rediscover what is important about his faith, but he isn’t too grand to operate in small-scale ways: forcing Henry to negotiate with a fearsome donor by somehow sticking his trousers to his chair; fixing the bottle of port belonging to Professor Wutheridge so that it is somehow always full; decorating the Bishop’s Christmas tree and doing his filing, both in the blink of an eye
    Now I have a machine gun
 Ho ho ho
 – John McClane
Physical danger is the obstacle in several less traditional Christmas movies, including Jingle All the Way, Home Alone and We’re No Angels, but the greatest of these is surely Die Hard
 New York cop John McClane, played by Bruce Willis, has landed in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve, hoping to seek a reconciliation with his estranged wife, Holly (in the book on which the film is based, Nothing Lasts Forever, the policeman is visiting his daughter, Stephanie, so it seems reasonable to suggest that changing the character’s name to Holly is itself a Christmassy shift)
 McClane arrives at Holly’s workplace in the Nakotomi Plaza, only to find himself in the midst of a terrorist attack
 McClane is the only man capable of stopping the terrorists (actually thieves, conducting an audacious armed robbery), and one of the film’s most glorious moments is when Hans Gruber (the much-missed Alan Rickman) reads the note left by McClane on the body of one of the criminal crew, “Now I have a machine gun
 Ho ho ho
” So it’s not just Ralphie who longs for a gun for Christmas
The dark side of Christmas
Die Hard fulfils another criterion of the archetypal Christmas film: it prizes family over money
 Gruber and his men are only interested in stealing a huge sum in bearer bonds
 They have chosen Christmas Eve for their attack, precisely because they hope to take advantage of the holiday: the Plaza is largely empty, the police are short-handed, so their target is at its most vulnerable
 John McClane, on the other hand, has flown across the country because he still loves his wife, and wants to make up for his shoddy behaviour in the past
 Holly loves him too, not least because it would take a heart of stone not to fall for a man who is single-handedly battling a building full of terrorists to win her back
 Money plays no role in their relationship, although Holly’s promotion (and likely pay rise) had helped to drive them apart
The film most closely associated with Christmas, It’s a Wonderful Life, reveals that the greatest jeopardy a character can find themselves in is psychological
 George Bailey (James Stewart) is helped to see the value of his life by trainee-angel, Clarence
 Having given up on his dreams of adventure in order to do the right thing by his family, George Bailey is a decent, patient man who seems as solid as the building-and-loan investment company in which he works
 But an ugly twist of fortune and the hostility of the evil Mr Potter sees both George and his company in trouble, and George considers suicide
The film is much darker than people remember: George Bailey’s brush with death is real and agonising to watch
 There’s a similar moment in another James Stewart classic, The Shop Around the Corner, in which the shopkeeper Mr Matuschek discovers that his wife is having an affair with one of his staff
 He is only saved from suicide by gunshot because the errand boy arrives back at the shop just in time
 As the staff rally round him in the run-up to Christmas, we get caught up in the romance between Alfred and Miss Novak (Stewart and Margaret Sullavan), and almost forget the agony we’ve witnessed
The best Christmas films put their characters through the ringer: financial or physical dangers often provoking profound emotional trauma
 Christmas is what pulls them back from the brink
 These movies rate love over money, family above gain, and add a little magic to the whole affair
 If magic doesn’t fit, a gut-punch musical number will do (Judy Garland’s melancholy Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas in Meet Me in St Louis is the ideal)
 As the Muppets have it: “It is the summer of the soul in December
”
If lust is red, sadness is blue, and cowardice is yellow, what colour defines defiance
 An arresting image that emerged this week promises to add a new hue to the symbolic colour-wheel that spins inside us
 The  Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny posted a video message on his website after he was allegedly attacked on the streets of the Siberian city Barnaul
(Credit: Alexei Navalny)
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was allegedly sprayed with green liquid in a bizarre attack (Credit: Alexei Navalny)
Navalny’s face was splattered with a vibrant green liquid, staining his complexion, in a spiteful act that many believe was intended to intimidate the harsh critic of Putin’s government
 Far from silencing its target, however, the vindictive dousing that has temporarily transformed Navalny’s countenance into something strange and striking (the verdant blotching is expected to last a few days before fading) has only emboldened him
Surrounded by supporters, the politician resolved to document his transitory disfigurement by taking a defiant selfie and circulating it on Facebook and Twitter as a show of resilience
 In doing so, Navalny has, intentionally or not, adopted an ancient cultural disguise – one that channels the power of a tradition of green-skinned deities dating back to both the Egyptian underworld and the iconography of Medieval architecture
(Credit: Wikimedia)
Osiris, the Egyptian god of regeneration, was typically depicted with a green face (Credit: Wikimedia)
Typically depicted with a lush green face, Osiris, the Egyptian god of regeneration, resurrection and the afterlife, was intimately associated with the rebirth of spring each year
 That Navalny was assaulted on Monday, 20 March – the precise date of 2017’s vernal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, marking the start of spring – adds a further layer of curious coincidence to his supposed reincarnation as an ever-verdant and irrepressible political force
Paralleling Osiris’s grassy complexion in western art – and deepening the symbolic resonances of Navalny’s accidental recasting – is the proliferation across European architecture since at least 400 AD of the so-called ‘Green Man’: a face fashioned from leafy limbs and verdurous vines exhaled through the mouth, carved or sculpted (sometimes surreptitiously) as decoration in secular and religious structures alike
 Some mystery surrounds the precise motivation for secreting these unorthodox motifs in predominantly Christian contexts, such as Norwich Cathedral
It seems likely that such emblems, which flouted Christian iconographic conventions, sought to unify into a single potent symbol both pagan and pious beliefs in rebirth and miraculous fertility
 His cheeks bloated, belching life, the Green Man is an archetype of audacity in the face of winter’s deathly dominion – one that, echoing down the centuries, intensifies the impact of this week’s insolent and subversive selfie from Siberia
 For the moment at least, defiance has found its colour: cheeky green
In the 1960s, writes Catherine Ingram, space travel had a different colour
 As the US artist Andy Warhol described it, back then “silver was the future, it was spacey – the astronauts wore silver suits”
 This photo of British astronaut Tim Peake’s spacewalk reminds Ingram of Warhol’s 1966 work Silver Clouds, with “a sense of the infinite – that there are no walls or ceiling or floor; that where you are goes on forever”
February: A soldier in the Free Syrian Army stands guard
Taken as a major ceasefire in the war in Syria came into effect, this photo shows a soldier who “seems forever poised on a threshold”, according to Kelly Grovier
 Arguing that the perspective of this photo works in the same way as a 19th-Century trompe l’oeil, he looks at how news photos help break down “the barrier between the stresses of a conflict raging in an inconceivable elsewhere and the retinas of distant readers”
March: The father who saved his son
Snapped at the instant when a bat slipped from the hands of a baseball player and a fan instinctively stretched out his arm to save his son, this heart-stopping photo went viral in March
 Kelly Grovier looked at a 16th-Century painting, the viral image reinvesting it with a horror that time has blunted
April: Ruins at Palmyra
After Palmyra was retaken by Syrian forces, a photographer captured the extent of the damage wrought by militants
 Joseph Eid held up a picture he’d taken of the Arch of Triumph at the ancient city in 2014 – against the backdrop of the arch in ruins, after it was destroyed by the so-called Islamic State
 Kelly Grovier looked at Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn (1995), by the Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei, a work that Grovier believes is “cruel to be kind by forcing observers to confront an isolated, if vivid, instance of the destruction of heritage he believes is raging all around us in a world obsessed with the superficial rewards of the fast-and-easy here and now”
May: The woman who defied neo-Nazis
A photo of a single figure standing up against nationalists at a rally in Sweden went viral in May
 When Afro-Swedish social activist Tess Asplund came face-to-face with a May Day march of 300 uniformed nationalists in Borlänge, she faced them silently, fist clenched
 Her spontaneous reaction was unstaged and yet, according to Kelly Grovier, the image has all the “power of Delacroix’s epoch-defining painting” Liberty Leading the People (1830)
June: A Chinese lawyer with torn clothes
Taken in Nanning, Guangxi, this photo shows a lawyer outside a district court
 He told reporters that when he refused to hand over his mobile phone, court officials violently attacked him and nearly ripped his clothes off his body
 It reminded Kelly Grovier of paintings in which “a sacrificial figure, humiliatingly stripped of his clothes by brutish authorities, stands before a court of justice”
July: Kissing policemen
After a kiss between two male police officers was captured during the Pride Parade in London, Kelly Grovier looked at one of Banksy’s most famous images, the 2004 mural known as Kissing Coppers
 “Characteristically ambiguous,” writes Grovier, “Banksy’s mural assumes a sense of shock on the part of passers-by,” he says, as if suggesting that such affectionate behaviour is “incongruous for police officers”
August: A human pyramid
Taken during a festival in Barcelona’s Gràcia district, this photo “shows scores of Barcelonans in a surge of torsos and limbs that culminates in the outstretched arms of a soaring figure atop the living tower”, according to Kelly Grovier
 It adopts “an optical technique on which old masters relied to elevate the spirits of those who observed their works” – seen in paintings including Gericault’s Raft of the Medusa and Francis Bacon’s screaming Popes
September: A protestor in Santiago
“Staring is power,” writes Kelly Grovier
 “The ability to command another’s gaze, to transfix their mind and muscles by using nothing more than… one's unblinking eyes, requires discipline and courage of purpose
” This photo of a standoff between a protester and a Chilean policeman in Santiago prompted Grovier to consider the meaning of an unflinching gaze
 In her 2010 work The Artist is Present, performance artist Marina Abramović stared into the eyes of visitors
 It was a reminder of John Ruskin’s belief that “All great and beautiful work has come of first gazing without shrinking into the darkness
”
October: Man and machine
After the world’s first Cybathlon – an international competition for disabled athletes assisted by robotic technology – Kelly Grovier looked at art’s fascination with the blurred boundary between man and machine
 The contest, in the Swiss city of Zurich, included “competitors whose physical shapes are a fusion of athleticism and cutting-edge engineering”
 Grovier found echoes in Umberto Boccioni’s Unique Forms of Continuity in Space (1913), “which seems to liquify flesh and machine into a newly discovered amalgam”
November: A sinkhole in Japan
On the day of the US election, a sinkhole appeared in Japanese city of Fukuoka
 Social media users were quick to see the event as an omen, offering competing prophecies attached to the crater
 Kelly Grovier found a comparison with Sandro Botticelli’s The Abyss of Hell (c
1485), a “spiralling chasm that connects the realm of reality from the plunging depths of the underworld” – not because it seemed to imply a dark vision of the future, but because Botticelli’s ambivalent point of view reconciled “two divergent vantages without privileging one or disparaging the other”
December: Stars in time-lapse
We began the year with a spacewalk, and end with the stars – as shown in this time-lapse photo taken in Indonesia
 Kelly Grovier describes the image as “an arresting distortion of what the eye actually observes in the universe around it”, comparing it with Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night
 Now one of the world’s most famous paintings, it was dismissed by the artist months after it was painted for being too abstract
 “I allowed myself to be led astray”, the Dutch post-Impressionist wrote in a letter in November 1889, “into reaching for stars that are too big”
 Many would disagree with his verdict; Grovier concludes with a quote from Calvin and Hobbes: “If people sat outside and looked at the stars each night, I’ll bet they’d live a lot differently”
Boy with rope at Toffee Park Adventure Playground, London 2016
“Childhood has its ways of seeing, thinking, and feeling,” wrote Jean-Jacques Rousseau in Emile, his 1762 treatise on education
 “Nothing is less sensible than to try and substitute our ways”
 Mark Neville’s photos steer clear of imposing adult ways of thinking or seeing
 A new book of his photos, Child’s Play, coincides with an exhibition at the Foundling Museum in London – this image shows a boy at an adventure playground in London
 “Play is still a complete mystery to me, on so many different levels,” Neville tells BBC Culture
 “Part of the attraction is trying to make visible something which is mysterious

“There are so many images of children that are dull and benign and meaningless, where they’re smiling blandly,” says Neville
 “The reality of everyone’s childhood is very different, it’s much more complex than the picture we’re fed of children conventionally
” In the book, Foundling Museum curator Nicola Freeman describes how the 18th-Century painters Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough created what were called ‘fancy pictures’ of street children that “presented a palatable, sanitised view”
 Neville’s images are more like those of the artist William Hogarth, a governor of the Foundling Hospital who “drew on his personal experience of working with vulnerable children,” Freeman says
 “He was uniquely willing to show their more disturbing characteristics: the anarchic energy of children and the cruelty of which they are capable – capable, in fact, of all that adults are capable”

“Healthy play is one in which kids get to direct the play,” Neville says
 “It’s about kids negotiating their own barriers, and their own skills and communication and being part of a group
” In Neville’s pictures, children clutch saws, stir boiling pots and stare defiantly at the camera
 It’s a side to childhood that is neglected in carefree, traditional depictions
 Former play-worker and government adviser Adrian Voce has called play children’s “forgotten right”
 In Child’s Play, he describes how children burn off more energy in free play than they do in organised sports – and how research has revealed that it triggers the formation of new connections between brain cells
 “Playing literally causes the brain, the whole nervous system in fact, to grow and develop
” (Credit: Mark Neville)

The ability to play away from adult supervision is key to healthy development, Neville believes
 “Child mental illness is on the increase, childhood obesity is a problem and young people self-harming has risen dramatically,” he says
 “To my mind it’s clear there’s a connection between that and shrinking childhoods, by which I mean the privatisation of space – adventure playgrounds are being closed down, and the time for play has been gradually eroded through school scheduling
” His photos are an attempt to reveal something that has often been ignored
 “It’s almost invisible to us as adults

But in making play visible, we should be wary of drawing on preconceptions
 In his 2011 book The World in Play, Matthew Kaiser claims that “we have fallen in love with play, so that thinking rigorously about it means breaking our own hearts”
 But we need to change that outlook, says Kaiser, and “sweep aside the sentimental fluff, thoughts of frolicking toddlers and utopian politics”
 Voce agrees
 “Children play wherever they find themselves, and most of them live in neither Arcadia or Dystopia

Voce lists different theories of why children play, including those of the philosophers Friedrich Schiller and Herbert Spencer, “who proposed that playing is a manifestation of the ‘surplus energy’ accrued by the young whilst protected by their parents from the demands of survival… it is through the play of the young that art and transcendental culture emerges
” From another perspective, psychologist Karl Groos found that “playing is the way the young rehearse and master the adaptive skills necessary for survival”, according to Voce
 And, he adds, more recently psychologists have found that play is a fundamental way for children “not only to maintain emotional wellbeing, but also to grow in self-knowledge and fulfilment; a key to being able to fully experience both the vitality and the peace of living in the here and now

“I saw how important play was when I went to war zones,” says Neville
 “I went to a town in Ukraine that had been bombed hours earlier, and kids were out playing again immediately – they need it, it's like a therapy, an outlet to retreat into their own worlds and perform, act, play, engage
 That’s really key
” According to Voce, “even in situations of severe privation – war, bereavement, poverty and displacement – children will find the space to play
” He says this is their “way of being resilient, adapting to life’s challenges by subverting and having fun with them or, when necessary, simply escaping from them into self-constructed or imagined other worlds

“There are three photos of a girl in a headscarf at a girls’ school in Afghanistan,” says Neville
 “We’d driven for several hours to get there – a girls’ school at the time was a rarity, the Taliban restricted education for girls
 We arrived, and there was an outdoor lesson being held in a compound
 This girl at the back of the class just turned around and started performing almost like a silent movie star, like a character from Sunset Boulevard – very Norma Desmond, dramatic scarf movements
 And I thought ‘that is a parody of how she imagines Western culture to be’,” he says
 “It was amazing

“It is interesting when kids start playing to camera, and technically it helps me because it’s very difficult to get a good shot of kids playing – normally they’ve got their backs to you and they’re in a group or a huddle, which doesn’t make a very interesting photo
 As soon as you get someone who turns around and looks at you or the camera, immediately you can start to have a relationship with what’s going on
” This boy approached Neville after watching him for some time
 “He saw me taking photos, and I had the big flash attached to my camera – it’s quite bright,” he says
 “I was in a line of soldiers on patrol and he saw me taking pictures – he followed us for a while, and then he saw a puddle of mud and he stuck his hands in it then brought them up and made an extended finger movement to emulate a bulb flash going off, he was trying to mimic my flash going off with these muddy hands, it was a wonderful moment of theatre

Neville’s view of childhood has shifted over the years
 “You’d be out on patrol and you’d see them coming out of the bushes in pairs like phantoms – these very young children completely unaccompanied – and you’d think ‘where are they going
 Who’s looking after them
 Where have they come from
’ And there’s nothing to be seen for miles around,” he says
 Yet despite that, he could see common themes around the world
 “There’s a sense in which you can see the timelessness about play
 You see that in the pictures I took in Kenya, of the kids trundling a hoop – exactly the same game was played in Afghanistan, and it was played in Victorian times
 The origins of these games seem intercontinental somehow – transferable – there’s something universal about them, and the need to do them

Neville photographed this First Nation reserve five years ago – and some of his images have never been seen before
 “I’ve waited to exhibit them because I wanted there to be a good enough reason,” he says
 “The child suicide rates are high because their conditions are so desperate
 There’s no sense of hope, and that sense of hopelessness and despair transfers to the kids
 It’s not just about money, it’s about a sense of self-worth and esteem and value, which has been taken away from them
” As Voce argues, “Childhood is a construct, tending to reflect the mores and aspirations – and the anxieties – of its times and culture
 The pervasive (Western world) view of it still owes much to the Romantics, who painted an ideal of the ‘good childhood’, with playing children conceived as ‘humanity’s closest connection to the purity and harmony of nature’

This image shows children involved in something that’s both a game and a live-saving task
 “They take it in turns to do it, they dig a hole with their hands, and lean down and suck up water and spit it out to one side,” says Neville
 “If they do that enough, the water becomes purer and purer and they can actually drink from it
 They treat it as a game, they’re laughing and joking while they do it – two boys do it one after another, and then another two other boys take over, and the reward is at the end of it they get pure drinking water
 It’s partly game, partly survival tactic

Neville likes the ambiguity in this photo
 “I think there are so many contradictions,” he says
 “There’s something conspiratorial about it, there’s some other narrative going on between the three of them beyond the rehearsal
 The central figure looks very old and very young at the same time, very serious and yet in costume
” Their stance is challenging rather than subservient
 According to Freeman, Neville’s photos “allow children the authority to address us, fix us, and demand something of us”

Often in his photos from Afghanistan, Neville says, “The kids aren’t really playing, but the whole notion of what play might be, or childhood, seems to be recalibrated because of the context
” Throughout the book, there is defiance as well as silliness; doubt as well as swagger
 “Children have immense energy, innate power,” writes Voce
 “But unlike the always-smiling, fun-loving angels of marketing stereotype, children are just people – manifesting all shades of emotion as they live and play with the gamut of human experience
 At play, where they are both most free and most in control, they are able to give the fullest expression to the whole spectrum of what it means to be a child, dealing with life, encountering the world in all its ugliness as well as its beauty, and then reinventing it, moment by playful moment

The pull of the red carpet on Academy Awards night has almost come to rival the Oscars show itself, according to Tom Brook
 He talks to the actor Maggie Gyllenhaal about its appeal
“It’s a pleasure to get to wear these beautiful dresses,” she says
 “It’s like being in an old movie, it’s the kind of things that Ginger Rogers would have worn, or Katharine Hepburn
”
For some fashion insiders, it’s one of the highlights of the year
 “I think you can 100 per cent give birth to a style,” says Hollywood stylist Karla Welch
 “There’s an unbelievable power in a very good red carpet moment, where it announces to the world ‘here I am’

“A report on 2017 art trends predicts the connoisseur collector is a dying breed,” says Linda Kennedy in this video from Art Basel Hong Kong
 “Once men and women of leisure, now they’re more likely to be hedge fund managers wanting fast fine art and sculpture to go
”
She talks to gallerist Pascal de Sarthe about how to be a connoisseur collector – and gets tips on observing details in artworks from Angelika Li, director of a Hong Kong cultural institute that interprets art and its meaning for the community
Kennedy also looks at how a new generation are getting ‘art smart’ on social media
 Culture writer Vivienne Chow tells her: “It helps building knowledge, and it’s much less intimidating than going into a gallery

Art is ungaggable
 Like truth, it cannot be silenced
 As tyrants throughout history have invariably discovered, quashing free expression, whether journalistic or creative, is, at best, an exercise in postponement
 It roars back
 A powerful photo from Ciudad Juárez in Mexico that has circulated in the news this week reminds us of the shared resilience of art and truth and how their determination to be heard and seen and felt can never be quieted
The image, captured by the photographer Jose Luis Gonzalez, is an intense close-up of a woman protesting the murder of a reporter who investigated organised crime and drug trafficking
 The third Mexican journalist to be killed in the space of a month, Miroslava Breach was shot eight times in her car in the company of one of her children (who was not injured)
 Officers investigating the crime found a taunting note left by her assailants
 It read, “For being a loud-mouth”
Journalists are reflected in the sunglasses of a woman at a protest against the murder of the Mexican journalist Miroslava Breach (Credit: Reuters/Jose Luis Gonzalez)
After news broke of Breach’s murder, fellow journalists staged a demonstration against authorities whom they hold responsible for failing to curb the escalating attacks on reporters
 Though the young woman in Gonzalez’s photo is probably a journalist too, it is difficult to know for sure given the eerie thoroughness of her self-denying disguise
 Masked by a pair of large reflecting sunglasses and, stretched across her shut lips, a wide swathe of duct tape on which the words “Ni uno” and a plus sign (“not one more”) have been written in defiance, the anonymous woman is as absent as she is present
The female protester, whose cropped and magnified face occupies the image’s entire visual field, may appear at first glance to be the primary subject of the photo
 In fact what has been captured by Gonzalez is the tireless fortitude of free expression in the face of even the most menacing intimidation
 Look deeper into the mirroring surface of the woman’s left lens (the one on our right) and we see the photographer himself gazing back, suspended forever in the act of shooting the very picture at which we’re looking – his face half-eclipsed by the wide yawn of his penetrating zoom
 Rare in photojournalism, which demands the removal of subjectivity from the story, Gonzalez’s image is an audacious self-portrait of truthful reporting – an endless ricochet of unstoppable staring
Cesare Ripa’s Iconologia, which features allegories devoted to various human pursuits, includes one devoted to the art of painting (Credit: Università di Bergamo)
Further intensifying the resonances of his image is a distant, though uncanny, art historical echo that locates Gonzalez’s photo in the tradition of celebrating the irrepressibility of art, truth, and the truth of art
 In 1603, an Italian butler to the recently deceased Cardinal Antonio Maria Salviati published an enormous volume he’d compiled in his spare time of allegorical representations (both verbal and visual) of every human quality, pursuit, and state of mind one could name, from jealousy to generosity, sincerity to superstition
Among the more intriguing entries in Cesare Ripa’s bulging Iconologia, which went on to inspire generations of artists (including Johannes Vermeer), is the one devoted to painting, or “Pittura”
 Its essence, as crystallised by Ripa, is a woman with a theatre mask hanging from her neck (signifying art’s imitation of nature) who stands at an easel while holding a palette and fistful of brushes
 Her mouth is disturbingly gagged
 While the gag at the time probably symbolised the silence of the visual arts (as compared to poetry or music), when placed alongside this week’s striking photo from Mexico it absorbs an anachronistic urgency
 Art is a survivor
 It thrives when threatened
 Like truth, it cannot be silenced
On 26 April 1937, Nazi German and Italian bombers attacked the Basque city of Guernica
 Over the course of three hours, they destroyed three-quarters of the ancient town, killing and wounding hundreds
 The raid was “unparalleled in military history”, according to reports at the time – and it inspired one of the most famous anti-war paintings in history
 A new exhibition staged in London by Barcelona’s Mayoral Gallery honours a group of artists who responded to the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War
These artists were brought together by the 1937 Paris Exhibition, which opened less than a month after the bombing and just 10 months after the Civil War began
 The Exhibition is usually remembered for the competing bluster of two nations: Germany, with its monumental granite tower topped with a giant eagle and swastika, and the Soviet Union, whose marble-clad structure was capped by an even bigger statue of two figures clutching a hammer and a sickle
 Yet it also played host to a humbler project that has outlasted either monolith
 Mayoral’s exhibition commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Spanish pavilion, seen by the Second Spanish Republic as a way of revealing General Franco’s cruelty to the rest of the world against a backdrop of rising authoritarianism
Its ambitions were far removed from Nazi and Soviet architectural one-upmanship
 As Europe moved towards war, the situation in Spain took on significance around the world
 It became a battleground for the forces of Fascism and Communism and inspired new works from some of the greatest artists of the time
 Pablo Picasso, Julio González, Joan Miró, Alexander Calder, Alberto Sánchez, and José Gutiérrez Solan were all shown in the Spanish pavilion

Picasso was commissioned to create a mural for the pavilion, and had started on a series of anti-Nationalist images called Dream and Lie of Franco earlier in 1937
 After reading reports of the attack on Guernica by Franco’s allies, he began work on a painting that would come to symbolise the wider fight against Fascism
 According to the art historian Fernando Martín Martín, “For the first time in the contemporary history of war, a town and its civilian population had been annihilated both as a scare tactic and a way of testing the war machine
” He says this was the “instant Picasso knew what would be the subject of his mural for the pavilion
”
    In Guernica, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death – Pablo Picasso 
His painting, Guernica, is not on display at Mayoral (it is exhibited at Madrid’s Reina Sofía Museum) – but there are insights into its creation, including photographs taken by Picasso’s girlfriend at the time, Dora Maar
 The mural took him just over a month to complete
 While painting, to combat rumours that he supported the Nationalists, Picasso issued a statement: “In the panel on which I am working, which I shall call Guernica, and in all my recent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death”
Political canvas
The artists creating pieces for the pavilion were explicit in their aims
 Mayoral’s exhibition curator Juan Manuel Bonet says that “all the major works at the pavilion were fruits of a commission
 The special thing about this commission was that it was not intended to be a political commission; the artists took it upon themselves to react in such a way
”

Designed as a stamp to aid the Republican Government, Help Spain (Aidez L'Espagne) was one of Miró’s first political works (Credit: Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía)
It was a new outlook for some of them, says Bonet
 “Before 1936, neither Picasso nor Miró were very political; but the Spanish Civil War changed this
” According to him, 1937’s Dream and Lie of Franco by Picasso and Aidez l’Espagne (Help Spain) by Miró are the artists’ first overtly political works
 “Later on in their careers, Picasso joined the French Communist Party in 1944 and Miró continued to be very active against Franco’s regime into and during the 1960s and ‘70s
”
The American sculptor Alexander Calder’s contribution to the pavilion was also a piece of propaganda
 A supporter of the Republican cause and great friend of Miró, Calder was initially refused permission to create an artwork because he wasn’t Spanish, but the organisers relented after a marble fountain from Spain had to be repurposed
 It was filled with mercury that was poured through a series of sculptures created by Calder until it reached a mobile labelled ‘Almadén’

The word resonated with Republicans
 It was the name of a stronghold that held out against an offensive by Franco’s troops in March 1937, famous for its deposits of mercury, an element valued for its use in manufacturing weapons
 Calder’s piece, The Mercury Fountain, doubled as a symbol for Republican resistance
 “Nothing in the pavilion was free from intention,” writes Martín
    Guernica was not a picture but graffiti, though graffiti done by a genius – José Bergamín 
The exhibition has been put together with Joan Punyet Miró, historian and grandson of Joan
 It includes a reconstruction of his grandfather’s El Segador (The Reaper) – a mural painted onto construction material in situ which was then lost or destroyed after the pavilion was dismantled
 Showing a Catalan peasant with a huge misshapen head, it was a cry of outrage at the events in Spain
 “Of course I intended it as a protest,” said Miró
 “The Catalan peasant is a symbol of the strong, the independent, the resistant
”
Pop-up propaganda
Both The Reaper and Guernica were created as propaganda, in the manner of Soviet agitprop – “ephemeral art based on propaganda and agitation for a political cause aimed at stirring up the masses”, writes Joan Punyet Miró, arguing that the murals “looked like huge political propaganda posters”
 The poet José Bergamín commented that “Guernica was not a picture but graffiti, though graffiti done by a genius”

Painted on poor quality canvas, Guernica could easily have been destroyed as well
 According to Punyet Miró, “Neither of them chose a tough, hard-wearing support, for they knew in advance that these were ephemeral works, designed to cause an impact and then disappear along with the pavilion… Guernica was spared the same fate as Miró’s mural because Picasso was asked to send it to London and later to the United States”
    The painting was not to return to Spain until democracy had been returned – Juan Manuel Bonet 
As it turned out, the pavilion was only the beginning
 Guernica toured around the UK in 1938, says Bonet
 “Picasso later entrusted the painting to MoMA in New York, as it was his wish that the painting not return to Spain until democracy had been returned to the country
 This was symbolically very important
”
Through a dark lens
Guernica took on a wider meaning in the years that followed
 “It speaks about the Spanish Civil War, and the destiny of civilians in it, as well as the bombs that killed so many people in this Basque city,” says Bonet
 “It also remarks on all wars
” The French writer Michel Leiris was moved to say of it: “On a black and white canvas that depicts ancient tragedy… Picasso also writes our letter of doom: all that we love is going to be lost
”
Yet there was hope in it too
 Amid shrieking figures and corpses, Picasso left a beacon, according to Martín
 “At the top, stretching out from a window, a woman with an oil lamp seems to want to illuminate the encroaching panic and darkness
”

) by Ramón Puyol, who said “the rickety theory of art for art’s sake has just died” (Credit: CRAI Biblioteca del Pavelló de la República/Mayoral)
Guernica tapped into an earlier tradition, echoing Goya’s works commemorating resistance to the Napoleonic invasion of Spain
 According to curators at the Reina Sofía, “The grotesque vision that Goya brought to his political critique was not lost on artists as a powerful tool for crafting their own views of the present
” Picasso admired Goya’s “dark lens on Spain’s complex political and religious traditions”
“Picasso, Miró, Calder and González taught us that sometimes major moments such as the Spanish Civil War force us to take sides,” says gallery director Jordi Mayoral
 “The works created by these artists for the pavilion are still part of the Spanish collective memory; they represented a major turning point in the Civil War and the country’s struggle between democracy and fascism”
Picasso himself summed up his decision, remarking in 1937: “I have always believed and still believe that artists who live and work with spiritual values cannot and should not remain indifferent to a conflict in which the highest values of humanity and civilisation are at stake

Tis the season for festive movies – and Father Christmas has seized the spotlight in countless films around the world
 Santa’s on-screen looks have been fairly standard (red robe and hat, white beard, often portly, nearly always Caucasian), but his film sets have varied (from snowy Lapland to city grotto, and even outer space), and his character has certainly shape-shifted across genres
 Santa has been played as a jolly good guy, an unhinged killer, a romantic lead, and of course, an anti-hero, with the return of Billy Bob Thornton’s Bad Santa 2
 Here are 12 Santas of Christmas movies, past and present
The debut appearance
The Visit of Santa Claus, 1898
Cinema was in its infancy when Father Christmas made his first trail-blazing appearance on screen in this magical silent British short
 The hypnotic black-and-white scenes depict a mysterious, rather meticulous Santa arriving in style via the fireplace, to leave goodies in stockings for two snoozing children
 (Credit: YouTube)
The wartime enigma
The Killing of Father Christmas (L'assassinat du Père Noël), 1941
Christmas miracles happen – but so does murder in the snow – in this Gothic thriller with a festive backdrop
 A globe-maker (Harry Baur) plays Santa Claus for the close-knit community in a rural French village, and a shadowy whodunnit ensues when his body is found in the snow
 Pere Noel’s fate has an even darker edge when you consider that this was the first film to be produced in Nazi-occupied France
Grotto fabulous
Miracle on 34th Street, 1947
English actor Edmund Gwenn portrayed the original cuddly and gentlemanly department store Santa with this iconic New York movie role, blending realism, feel-good family drama, and a spirit-lifting fantasy twist
 The film – and Gwenn’s persona – have inspired numerous remakes and homages over the years, with Richard Attenborough taking the starring role in the 1994 remake
Killer Santa
Silent Night, Deadly Night, 1984
Although 1974 Canadian horror Black Christmas is credited as an influential slasher film, Santa himself didn’t turn murderous until a little later
 The first appearance of Saint Nick as serial killer was arguably this gory movie, in which a tormented youth goes on the rampage while dressed as a store Santa
 From here, Santa developed a taste for blood in a spate of holiday horrors, including the spooky Dutch folklore of Sint (2010) and 2015 anthology A Christmas Horror Story
Down-and-out Santa
Trading Places, 1983
When his former bosses subject him to a cruel bet, rich Philadelphia broker Winthorpe (Dan Aykroyd) loses everything – and he’s reduced to crashing the office Christmas party (and raiding the buffet) in a ragged Santa Claus outfit
 Impressively, he manages to conceal an entire salmon inside his filthy beard
The blockbuster name
Santa Claus: The Movie, 1985
This big-budget, brand-heavy family movie turned out to be a box-office flop, though it does feature US actor David Huddleston as a larger-than-life Santa who flies his sleigh over New York landmarks, and must adapt to an era of mass production
 Dudley Moore shares the spotlight as an ingenious elf helper
The animated figure
The Nightmare Before Christmas, 1993
Tim Burton’s stop-motion dark festive fantasy has macabre/cute anti-hero Jack Skellington hijacking Christmas as the self-styled “Sandy Claws”, who even has his own coffin-sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer
 A showdown with the bemused real Santa Claus ensues
The everyman
The Santa Clause Trilogy, 1994-2006
US comedian Tim Allen plays a regular guy and divorced father who is contracted to stand in for the real Santa Claus in this family comedy film series
 The 2002 sequel has Santa searching for a new “Mrs Claus” (female characters invariably play support roles in Santa films), but the response to follow-ups suggested that this series was not the gift that keeps on giving
Santa on the run
Divine Intervention, 2002
Nazareth-born film-maker Elia Suleiman sets the surreal tone for his award-winning Palestinian black comedy/romance with an early scene where a wounded Santa (George Ibrahim) struggles to flee a group of children, with presents falling from his sack, before revealing that he has been stabbed
The love interest
The Perfect Holiday, 2007
It’s notable that despite numerous appearances in film and TV, there is little deviation from Santa as white guy
 Black American cinema has produced a few examples, from the Blaxploitation flick Black Santa’s Revenge (2007), to unabashedly feel-good modern romance The Perfect Holiday
 In the latter, Morris Chestnut plays a handsome department store Santa and aspiring musician, who makes divorced mom Gabrielle Union’s Christmas wish come true
The eco warrior
X-mas, Inc
, 2008
A kindly Santa (late Latin American screen icon Pedro Armendáriz Jr, in one of his final roles) takes a stand against global warming and consumerist greed in this Mexican comedy, as the North Pole ice caps are melting, and a greedy elf-entrepreneur aims to turn Christmas into a capitalist fiesta
Naughty, not nice
Bad Santa, 2003 and Bad Santa 2, 2016
Unshaven, uncouth and strangely charismatic… Billy Bob Thornton’s anti-hero Santa is more concerned with mall heists than goodwill, though a kind heart sometimes glints beneath the sleazy exterior
 The conman returns unreformed, and with an equally no-good Mother Christmas (Kathy Bates) for a movie sequel this season
 Eminem also took on the guise in the video for his 2004 hit, Just Lose It, including a cameo from Bad Santa’s helper co-star, Tony Cox

 And are our politicians and leaders in fact shapeshifting reptilian humanoids
“Fake news and conspiracy theories are nothing new,” says Clare Grafik, head of exhibitions at London’s Photographers’ Gallery, which has mounted a nine-day programme of exhibitions and talks on this theme, billed as “Conspiracy Week”
    The intervention of a machine gives photography the illusion of unbiased observation – Gordon MacDonald 
“But they are spilling into the mainstream to an extent we have not seen
 Now that anyone can pass on conspiracy theories to numerous others via the web, the potential for them to be disseminated has exploded exponentially
”
The centrepiece of Conspiracy Week is an exhibition called Divisive Moments, which draws upon the archives of Wendelle C Stevens (1923-2010), a former US Air Force pilot and prominent UFO research pioneer
 During his 50-year career, Stevens amassed one of the world’s largest collections of UFO photographs
Moonlanding

“We felt that the UFO story was a softer way to introduce a debate about current issues,” explains Grafik
 “There’s a sense now that, if the world doesn’t fit your view, you can create your own reality through the web, where forums foster enclosed debates
 You no longer have to subjugate your own opinion to the realities of the world
”
This encourages the proliferation of conspiracy theories, Grafik says
 She also believes that the prominence of conspiracy theories is a factor in the changing face of global politics: “You could even say that Donald Trump has come out of this new culture of conspiracy theory – that the explosion of conspiracy on the web has made a figure like him possible
”
Who do conspiracy theories appeal to
 “People who feel that the world isn’t providing them with the reality they want,” Grafik says
 “In a world that seems overwhelming and complex, it’s attractive to find a narrative that somehow ties things down – even if that narrative is, to other people, completely outlandish
 There’s a natural human instinct to try to make sense of things, in whatever way you can
”
Flying saucer

Moreover, within the murky world of conspiracy theories, photography plays a crucial role
 Many conspiracy theorists construct arguments based on ‘evidence’ offered by photographs in the public domain, which they endlessly analyse and debate
“This is because photographs are the most accepted form of eyewitness evidence,” explains Gordon MacDonald, curator of Divisive Moments
 “The intervention of a machine [ie a camera] gives photography the illusion of unbiased observation
 And, of course, photography is very easy to distribute and consume: it’s easy to skim over the information in a photograph, whereas reading text requires effort
”
Of course, the idea that the camera never lies is demonstrably untrue
 Here, we select five photographs commonly used by conspiracy theorists and people with an interest in the paranormal to ‘prove’ their beliefs
Flying saucers
Flying saucer
Billy Meier claimed he was in contact with aliens from the Pleiades star cluster, and had the photographs to prove it (Credit: Collection of Gordon MacDonald)
In 1979, Stevens published a book called UFO: Contact from the Pleiades
 It investigated the claims of a Swiss farmer called Billy Meier who said that he was in contact with aliens from the Pleiades star cluster, and had the photographs to prove it
 Stevens’s book subjected Meier’s photographs – a series of landscapes in which indistinct circular metal forms appear to float and hover against mountainous backdrops – to quasi-scientific tests
 Drawing upon early digital technology, these were designed to determine the photographs’ veracity
 Stevens concluded that the photographs weren’t doctored
However, he did not consider the possibility that they were faked in other ways (for instance, Meier could have dangled his saucepan-like ‘spaceships’ from out-of-shot trees, using thin, hard-to-spot wires)
 “Just because photographs are real – ie real images made with a real camera – doesn’t mean they are of what the person says they’re of,” explains MacDonald
 While researching ufology, MacDonald noticed a trend: “Flying saucers tend to get spotted by white males in remote areas – the Swiss Alps, deserts in Nevada, rural Argentina, Mexico – rather than by masses in urban areas
 There’s never been a claim that a spaceship was spotted by 10,000 people on Oxford Street, for instance – though perhaps there will be during our show
”
Rama the alien
Rama

Sightings of UFOs have been reported for decades, and photographs of aliens and spaceships are, if not 10-a-penny, then commonplace
 MacDonald, though, is only aware of a single example of a photograph supposedly taken not of an alien but by one: an amiable creature from outer space called Rama, the protagonist of a little-known abduction case that supposedly occurred in the Brazilian city of Botucatu in the 1980s
“The story is that this Brazilian guy, Joao Valerio da Silva, and his eldest son were abducted by Rama the alien on a regular basis, and taken to his home planet to have sex with the females to repopulate it,” MacDonald says
 Stevens devoted a book to this, as he put it, “strange” case in which one abductee recalled that a female alien he had encountered “had a bosum [sic] like they have in India
 A thing most attractive
”
Stevens also reproduced several atmospheric photographs depicting a shadowy humanoid figure whom the claimants said was their extra-terrestrial friend, Rama
 There was even a peculiar photograph of the lower half of da Silva’s face, featuring his bushy moustache, that was, they said, taken by Rama himself
 “What’s considered photographic proof is an odd thing,” says MacDonald
 “Lots of people claim to have been abducted, but someone borrowing a point-and-click camera, concealing it, and then going to an alien planet with it and taking photographs – I’ve not heard of that before
”
Moon landings

One of the most notorious conspiracy theories is that the six Apollo moon landings, which took place between 1969 and 1972, were hoaxes, and that the photographs released by NASA documenting them were faked
 This idea was first given substantial form by the former US Navy midshipman Bill Kaysing, who self-published a book outlining his theory, We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, in 1976
Those who believe in the moon-landing hoax argue that NASA’s motivation for hoodwinking the world was to create the impression that the Americans had won the space race against the Russians, when, in fact, they hadn’t
 “Kaysing was a well-educated man, and he believed his theory and followed it through in a very analytical way,” MacDonald says
 “When you read his concerns, they seem quite coherent, which is why people believe them
” Kaysing and his followers, many of whom continue to question the moon landings today, focus on supposed peculiarities of the NASA photographs, which are freely available on the agency’s website
MacDonald explains: “There were several contentions: that the same backdrop appears in different locations, so that it feels like a set; that shadows from boulders and astronauts run in different directions; and that too many photographs were taken, given the equipment they had at the time
” Of course, MacDonald continues, every argument has been countered by NASA – but the enduring popularity of Kaysing’s argument is significant, because it suggests an underlying motivation for conspiracy theories in general: the mistrust of governments and those in power
“It’s the same with UFO conspiracy theories,” MacDonald says
 “Often, there is an idea that governments are hiding something: look at Area 51
 There’s always an ‘us and them’ angle with conspiracy theories (otherwise who would be conspiring
) – and usually it’s governments who are the ‘them’
”
Life on Mars

Humans have speculated for a long time about the possibility of life on Mars, so when NASA released detailed images taken by the mast camera of its Curiosity robotic rover, which landed on the planet in 2012, conspiracy theorists, unsurprisingly, went into overdrive
 “People see shapes, faces, pyramids, insects – all kinds of stuff – on the surface of Mars,” says MacDonald
 “And much as NASA points out that there’s genuinely nothing there, that these are shadows and tricks of the light, the more the conspiracy theorists react against that voice of authority
 In fact, NASA are in a constant tug-of-war with conspiracy theorists
”
While many of the claims are humorous – one photograph supposedly contains a figure resembling Elvis Presley – some have gained traction, because they seem more “convincing”
 Last year, for instance, it was widely reported that within one of Curiosity’s photographs of Mars’s barren landscape, two crumbling pyramids appeared to be visible – evidence, it seemed, of a lost civilisation on the Red Planet
 “The Mars conspiracy theory is interesting,” MacDonald says, “because, unlike the moon landings, it isn’t suggesting fakery, but that actual alien life is being covered up by NASA
 And because people are seeing pyramids and recognisable human forms, such as statues, the suggestion is not only that alien life once lived there, but also, perhaps, that the alien life form was us
”
9/11
Tourist guy

Some of the darkest and most extreme conspiracy theories, capable of causing maximum offence, surround the attacks of 11 September, 2001
 A prominent one concerns the rapid collapse of the Twin Towers
 Some people suggest that this could not have not have been caused by the impact of the planes alone, and so must have been the result of controlled explosions detonated, for sinister purposes, by the US government – possibly to provide a pretext and support for war in the Middle East
While the 9/11 conspiracy theories have been dismissed by official investigators, those who believe them use traumatic photography of the attack and its aftermath to build their case
 “In general, the most impactful photographs of the World Trade Center, like the Falling Man, are genuinely horrific,” says MacDonald
 “They have been shown enough and we don’t need to see them again
”
Instead, MacDonald is more interested in a photographic hoax that emerged in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and quickly became an early Internet sensation, circulated via email
 Known as the ‘Tourist Guy’, the snapshot depicts a tourist standing on the observation deck of the World Trade Center seconds before the impact of one of the hijacked passenger airliners, which is visible behind him
 “The claim was that the emergency services found a camera in the rubble and that the film inside was taken away and processed and they found the last photographs of this tourist standing on top of the World Trade Center,” MacDonald explains
Later, the photograph was proved to be a fake – it was taken in 1997 by a Hungarian tourist who digitally altered it after 9/11, as a “joke”
 At the time, though, MacDonald says, “It became one of the first really widely circulated internet hoax conspiracies
 The idea that something was being covered up went around the world very quickly
” Why do people make up conspiracy theories
 “It’s hard to know,” MacDonald say
 “Why do people create viruses that break computers
 Ultimately, it’s about sensation, and having an effect
 If you release something like this into the world, you influence it
 Mostly, it’s about getting recognised

The Girls have grown up
 The show's creator Lena Dunham is now in her 30s and the sixth season of her caustic, Brooklyn-based comedy will be the last
 It starts this weekend on US TV, and from the trailer it appears there’s as much hook-up angst, mad dancing, and messed-up – but deep-running – friendship as ever
Despite being much hyped since its debut in 2012, Girls has lost its way at times: too implausible, too sociopathic, or just too damn sad, as characters dived deeper into their neuroses, rather than changing and growing
 It’s sometimes been easier to sneer at Girls than cheerlead for it
 And yet, we have a lot to be grateful to Dunham for
 Girls really was a game-changer
Girls season one
When Girls made its debut in 2012, it seemed radical that all four of its main characters were unlikeable and neurotic screw-ups (Credit: HBO)
While we may take it for granted now, remember how radical it seemed to see Dunham’s very normal, un-airbrushed naked body on display
 Or for all four of the main characters to be unlikeable, maddening screw-ups and failures
 Or to show sex and relationships as awkward and confused, lust-driven and dirty, painful and painfully funny
 Dunham did some major culture-shifting groundwork, laying a rough path for many other foul-mouthed, funny, and brutally honest female writers to stride down
It’s also worth recalling just how big a deal it was for a woman in her 20s to be allowed to write, produce, direct and star in her own TV show
 Five years later, this is no longer quite so rare
 Recent years have seen a slew of sharply unsentimental shows that have a strong female perspective: they are written by women, about women, starring said women, and often as much about friendships among women as they are about romantic pairings
    Women’s unabashed honesty about sex is the shiny new thread that binds all these comedies together 
Dunham got there first, but see also: Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson’s Broad City
 Jessica Knappett’s Drifters
 Inside Amy Schumer and her feature film Trainwreck
 Sharon Horgan with first Pulling, then Catastrophe, and then Divorce (which, admittedly, stars Sarah Jessica Parker instead)
Fleabag one

And they keep coming: the BBC’s Fleabag, written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a strong contender for best TV show of 2016 – and became a smash in the US also after being picked up by Amazon
 Fleabag starts with an anal sex scene, and only gets more explicit, with the anti-heroine getting dumped for masturbating to Obama speeches
Crossing the pond in the other direction was Issa Rae’s Insecure, a show on HBO that made it to Sky Atlantic in the UK; a second season is on its way this year
 It follows Issa, a woman at the end of her 20s wondering if she should dump her boyfriend; her best mate, meanwhile, has such bad dates she worries that she’s got a “broken pussy” (which Issa performs a rap about at an open mic night: “maybe it’s really rough/or maybe it’s had enough
”)
Chewing Gum
Michaela Coel’s no-filter comedy Chewing Gum is set on a London council estate and follows a virgin’s clumsy sexual awakening (Credit: Alamy)
Meanwhile Chewing Gum has just made a welcome return to E4
 Michaela Coel’s refreshingly no-filter comedy, set on a London council estate, follows a 24-year-old Christian virgin’s clumsy sexual awakening; the first series wasn’t shy about showing her hilariously hapless attempts at blowjobs and threesomes, and the second seems so far to be just as loveably rude
'Wince-inducing truthfulness'
There are many things that these comedies have in common: flawed young women in the grip of existential and financial crises, a sense of being adrift in your 20s and 30s, being dissatisfied or confused by love and relationships
 Friendship among women is often central, but always shown to be complex and difficult as well as fun and loving
But women’s unabashed honesty about sex is the shiny new thread that binds all these comedies together
 Sex, after all, is funny
 And the human need to laugh about it is one that male comics have long exploited: from the most unreconstructed old stand-ups to the gross-out humour of ‘bromantic’ comedies, we’ve heard plenty about male bodily fluids and between-the-sheets action over the years
 Among female viewers, however, this may prompt eye-rolling; there was a time in the ‘00s when it felt like cinema was one long bad masturbation joke, dude, with female characters rarely more than attractive set dressing
Catastrophe two
Shows such as Sharon Horgan’s Catastrophe address the messy realities of women’s bodies and sexual experiences (Credit: Alamy)
While this new wave of female comedy writers may utilise slapstick or gross-out humour, the real laughs are most often due to their wince-inducing truthfulness
 There’s now a straight-up honesty about what it means to be a woman and have a body: masturbation, periods, abortions, sexual frustration, STDs and plain old bad sex are all common topics
 In a way that you rarely see in comedies written by men, sex, in these depictions, is often something that women totally enjoy and desperately want (think of pregnant Sharon in Catastrophe, mounting her partner in tears because she’s so hormonal and horny) and also something that’s comically messy or awkward
But there’s often darker emotional depth behind the laughs, with storylines that reveal how a lot of women’s emotional hang-ups still hinge on sex
 This isn’t blindly pom-pom waving sex positivism; it’s allowed to be nuanced
    Young women are more free, sexually active and experimental than ever – but are they really more empowered
Again, Girls should be celebrated for leading the way
 The show was brave in tackling a very modern, millennial dichotomy: young women are more free, sexually active and experimental than ever – as seen in various kinky bedroom scenes – but are they really more ‘empowered’ and having a great time
 Or is sex simply another way for women to please men, feeling pressured to do what’s expected of them
 In Girls, it’s been both; there are genuinely fun lost weekends with random guys, and there’s also rough sex where the woman is a prop in a man’s degrading fantasy
 But sex is complicated, and while young women may be more able to act on their desires than ever, shows such as Girls highlight how actually articulating those desires still isn’t always easy
 There’s comedy in bad sex, but there’s pain too
‘Unfunny’ women
Perhaps one of the most upsettingly honest aspects of Fleabag is how the protagonist uses sex as a form of validation
 She compulsively sleeps with men, the power of being able to make them want her a panacea for her pain and grief
 Even if the sex is lousy or soulless, it’s the distraction she craves, an external affirmation so she never need face herself
 This is dark, and complicated, but it rings true – it’s just a truth that we don’t talk about or admit to often
Fleabag sad

The bare-all honesty that defines these shows also reflects their own creative genesis
 For often, they are highly personal works
 Many lightly blur the boundaries of fiction and autobiography – these characters are performed by their creators, after all, and often even share their real-life names: Fleabag is Waller-Bridge’s nickname, then there’s Sharon in Catastrophe, Issa in Insecure, Ilana and Abbie in Broad City, Amy in Trainwreck
 It’s a striking trend
Content, too, tends to be drawn from life
 Aspiring writer Hannah Horvath in Girls certainly started, at least, as a proxy for Dunham
 Chewing Gum draws on Coel’s own estate background, and her rejection of religion, while Jessica Knappett’s character in Drifters lives in a grim attic she must climb a ladder to get into – just as her creator once did
 Writing Catastrophe with Rob Delaney, Horgan’s rule was that every plot point had to come from their own lives, or from someone they knew
Girls final season
TV programmes like Girls reveal that there’s comedy in bad sex, but pain too (Credit: HBO
There aren’t so many obviously semi-autobiographical comedies about men (Curb Your Enthusiasm aside), and these female creatives are often duly charged with narcissism
 Many of these programmes have been accused of being navel-gazing and narrow-focused, somehow less original or less valuable than fully fabricated counterparts
    Girls, and its progeny, have long been accused of only dealing with over-privileged whiny millennials 
There’s some truth in the narcissism charges – but, distinctively, many of these comedies also invite you in to share the joke
 Often, there’s a very strong point-of-view: Fleabag and Chewing Gum both break the fourth wall to directly address the viewer, offering a wry eyebrow raise at an absurd situation or even commenting on sex while it’s happening
 Insecure, meanwhile, uses voiceover and has Issa giving herself pep talks or hilarious little raps into the mirror/camera
 The effect is to include the viewer, to draw us in; we are their confidant, their partner in crime
 We are just like them, the shows suggest
Chewing Gum two
They often blur the line between fiction and autobiography; Chewing Gum draws on Coel’s own estate background and rejection of religion, for instance (Credit: Alamy)
It works – the joy of these programmes is that they’re both recognisable, and that little bit more embarrassing or outrageous than your own life
 Bingeing on them is a bit like spilling your guts with your naughtiest friend: however bad your weekend was, they’ve always got a worse story about terrible sex or getting drunk in front of their boss
 You laugh, you cringe, you relate – and you think at least your life isn’t quite that bad
Still, the charge that they’re too narrow could still stand: does everyone identify, or just other self-obsessed young women, like myself
 Girls, and its progeny, have long been accused of only dealing with over-privileged whiny millennials
Broad Central
Broad City, created by and starring Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, is based on their real-life friendship (Credit: Alamy)
But that’s almost besides the point – these shows offer a very personal point-of-view that is also highly gendered
 These programmes do indeed offer a notably female gaze, and its one that counteracts decades and decades of men behind the cameras
Certainly, there are quite a few of these women and their programmes around just at the minute – but then, women have still got a lot of lost ground to cover
 The female perspective for too long was denied, labelled ‘unfunny’
 Of course that was nonsense – a fact television is finally catching up on
 We’re long overdue women’s perspective on sex; it’s time to hear their stories
 And frankly, the filthier the better
Engaging with director Raoul Peck's handsome, well-acted, sincerely intentioned The Young Karl Marx is, with the benefit of historical hindsight, rather a bittersweet endeavour
 It's not hard to do: Peck's intelligent, textured film-making makes potentially arcane political discussions sing with urgency, and mostly airs out the parchment reek of academic fustiness
But though the ideas are rendered accessible, and sometimes practically thrilling, placed in their context (dutifully overliteralised with frequent intertitles that tell us exactly which town we're in, in which month of which year) anyone with a reasonable working knowledge of subsequent history may find their ability to celebrate the emotional crescendoes of this story a little compromised
 You do not have to blame Marx personally for the atrocities of 20th-Century communism to find it difficult to uncomplicatedly cheerlead the birth of the ideology's most influential early text
    Between this and The Young Pope we’re seeing a new trend whereby ‘young’ essentially becomes a euphemism for ‘sexy’ 
The Communist Manifesto, written in 1848 by Marx (August Diehl) and Friedrich Engels (Stefan Konarske), was a pamphlet that laid out the core ideas Marx would spend the rest of his life expanding upon, in his never-completed masterwork, Das Kapital
 The latter title, however, lies outside the remit of Peck's biopic, which culminates in the printing of the 'Manifesto' as a kind of triumphant opening salvo in the revolution to come
This narrowed focus allows Peck and co-screenwriter Pascal Bonitzer not only to spend the film's two-hour length (a little too) luxuriantly describing the infighting and internal schisms that dogged the nascent Communist League, but also to present a view of a vigorous and attractive Marx, as opposed to the two-tone-whiskered elder statesman of popular consciousness
 Between this and The Young Pope we're perhaps seeing a new trend whereby ‘young’ essentially becomes a euphemism for ‘sexy’ and ‘the sexy Karl Marx’ at least as played by the not unhandsome Diehl, is not the contradiction it might first appear
Young Karl Marx
The real romance here is the intense friendship forged between Marx and his 'Manifesto' co-author, the "bourgeois revolutionary" Engels (Credit: Neue Visionen Filmverleih)
In fact one of the film's unexpected strengths lies in its dual love stories, with Marx's wife Jenny (Colonia's Vicky Krieps) given a nice line in ready wit that frequently disarms the men around her
 And Engels' paramour Mary Burns (Wolf Hall's Hannah Steele), an outspoken Irish redhead who is first seen being dismissed from the Manchester factory Engels' father owns, is portrayed as something of a swashbuckling revolutionary
 Aside from the interesting, inverse class disparities in these two relationships there is dubious historical basis for much of the film's embellishment in this regard, but the addition of well-drawn, intelligent women is welcome even if they're mostly fictional
Marx + Engels: Vampire Hunters
But as in any story of the fathers of communism, the real romance here is the intense friendship forged between the frequently impoverished and exiled Marx and his 'Manifesto' co-author, the "bourgeois revolutionary" Engels, who loyally supported his friend, often financially
 And Peck does incorporate a few buddy-movie beats into his otherwise talky, dense film: Marx and Engels exchanging naughty-schoolboy glances as they await the verdict on their induction into the League of the Just (which they will join and, well, revolutionise); the pair getting roaring drunk and passing out in Marx's Paris apartment; and even a borderline slapstick sequence where they evade capture by pursuing authorities
 These moments point to the crasser, cruder Guy Ritchie genre mash-up that could have been - Marx & Engels Investigate
 perhaps, or Marx + Engels: Vampire Hunters - and though of course one's finer sensibilities rebel against such disrespect, watching The Young Karl Marx there may be a small corner of your soul that secretly wishes the film had been just a little more iconoclastic
    You might find yourself mentally calculating whether Peck would have had time, let alone inclination to finish on an image of the current US president, and what that might mean 
But Peck, the Haitian film-maker whose three-decade career has just been capped with an Oscar nomination for the incendiary James Baldwin documentary, I Am Not Your Negro, and whose Lumumba was such a stirring account of the rise and brutal fall of the Congolese leader, is on more mutedly respectful form here
 His film does not sink under the weight of the stovepipe hats and corsetry that constrict so many costume dramas -the mid-19th Century is evoked with a pleasingly worn-through vibe - but nor is it entirely immune to the pitfalls of the period drama
 In faithfully recounting the factionalism that characterised Marx's rise to prominence (there's an almost Darwinian feel to the way his intransigent elan defeats one political rival after another), the film gets a little lost in the reeds of specificity, and its relevance to contemporary events is dulled
This is an issue, because a clear-eyed interpretation of the ideological overthrow of the powerful, plutocratic few on behalf of the working masses would have irresistible applications to the political landscape of today, when perhaps the single most effective tactic employed by our current crop of demagogues has been to co-opt the rhetoric of the revolutionary left to their own, often diametrically opposed, agenda
 But not only is that forest lost for the trees of historical detail, the uncomplicated hero arc renders the parallel all but moot
 Marx's enemies within the left are portrayed to a man as blowhards, toadies, polemicists, has-beens or ineffectual pie-eyed idealists (they'd be the ‘libtards’ of today) whose defeat by our attractive, charismatic hero comes over as an unalloyed good
There is a late bid for relevance, when in the film's only anachronism, we cut to the credits and Bob Dylan's Like a Rolling Stone rings out over documentary footage of revolutionary movements and political figures from subsequent decades
 You might find yourself leaning closer as Vietnam protests give way to Reagan and Thatcher's special relationship, and mentally calculating whether Peck would have had time, let alone inclination, to finish on an image of the current US president, and what that might mean
 That he does not, and instead we close out on a generic image of burning dollar bills, tells you all you really need to know about The Young Karl Marx: well made and undeniably educational though it is, it can't help but feel like an opportunity for provocation, the kind of which its subject would no doubt have approved, has been missed
If you’re a fan of a particular romantic comedy, you’ve probably wondered what happened to its characters after the end credits rolled
 Did they stay as blissful as they were during that final close-up kiss
 Or did they spend their days arguing over whose turn it was to clean the bathroom
Fans of Richard Curtis’s ensemble rom-com, Love Actually, are about to find out
 For this year’s charity fundraiser, Red Nose Day, on 24 March, the writer-director has made a short sequel to his 2003 Christmas film, so we will soon see whether its various happy couples are still happy today
 But there is another, trickier question that the new film is less likely to answer
 How many of those couples were genuinely happy in the first place
Hugh Grant

Love Actually was Curtis’s directorial debut, but he was already Britain’s romantic-comedy king thanks to his screenplays for The Tall Guy, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill
 He even had his own theme song: The Troggs’ Love is All Around, as covered by Wet Wet Wet, topped the UK singles chart for 15 weeks when it was used in Four Weddings and a Funeral, and it reappeared as Christmas is All Around in Love Actually
 But is love really all around in Curtis’s groovy, fairy light-festooned London
 I’m not so sure
 The most peculiar aspect of Love Actually is how little love, actually, there is in it
    Lust Actually might have been a more appropriate title 
There is some, of course
 There is a woman’s devotion to her unstable brother, a widower’s sympathy for his stepson, and a drug-addled rock star’s blokey appreciation of his long-suffering manager
 But there is no romantic love as anyone over the age of 12 would understand it
 Nobody gets to know and appreciate somebody else’s unique qualities
 Nobody discovers that they can talk to that somebody for hours on end, or realises that he or she complements them in unexpected and life-enhancing ways
 Instead, most of the film’s main characters are smitten by someone they have barely spoken to
 You can see why Curtis went for the title he did, but Lust Actually might have been more appropriate
Harry and Sarah (Alan Rickman and Laura Linney) both fancy delectably exotic colleagues (Heike Makatsch and Rodrigo Santoro respectively)
 David (Hugh Grant) fancies his tea lady, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon)
 Jamie (Colin Firth) fancies his maid, Aurelia (Lucia Moniz)
 Sam (Thomas Sangster) fancies his schoolmate, Joanna (Olivia Olson)
 Colin (Kris Marshall) fancies the first American woman he lays eyes on
 And Mark (Andrew Lincoln) fancies his best friend’s wife, Juliet (Keira Knightley), a hankering he spells out on cue cards on her doorstep, while her new husband, Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor), is sitting a few feet away
 (What would Mark have done if Peter had answered the door
 Maybe the Red Nose Day sequel will reveal all
) 
Perfect
Mark (Andrew Lincoln) lets Keira Knightley’s character know he fancies her by spelling it out on cue cards (Credit: Alamy)
“To me, you are perfect,” says one of the cue cards
 What it doesn’t say is why Mark thinks she’s perfect
 What’s so special about her
 Obviously, Juliet is played by Keira Knightley, so she has an aesthetic advantage over most of us, but what else would prompt Mark’s misguided semi-public display of affection
 Is she funny
 Brave
 Kind to animals
 Does she share his interest in stamp collecting or Civil War battle re-enactments
 We will never know, just as we’ll never know what David sees in Natalie or what Jamie sees in Aurelia, because they don’t have any dialogue that reveals anything about any of them
‘Steady stream of bile’
And that’s what’s so perverse about Love Actually
 Curtis is a famously verbal screenwriter, and yet he ignores the idea that attraction can depend on what people say as well as on how they look
 Nor does he include any of the flirtatious banter that distinguishes It Happened One Night, Pillow Talk, The Apartment, When Harry Met Sally, and any other classic rom-com you care to name
 The strand in which the English Jamie and the Portuguese Aurelia can’t speak a word of each other’s language is just the most extreme example
Colin Firth
English Jamie (Colin Firth) falls for his Portuguese maid Aurelia (Lucia Moniz), without them ever exchanging any meaningful dialogue (Credit: Alamy)
It would be unfair to say that the characters in Love Actually don’t talk at all, though
 They do; it’s just that their talk consists almost entirely of insults, with a particular emphasis on body-shaming
 The film features two different fathers with weight-related pet names for their daughters (“Plumpy” and “Miss Dunkin’ Donuts 2003”), as well as an ageing rocker (Bill Nighy) who goes on and on about how “chubby” his manager (Gregor Fisher) is
 If you didn’t know it was a romantic comedy, you could easily mistake it for a science-fiction fable set on a parallel Earth beset by a Tourette’s Syndrome pandemic
 In this dystopian reality, somebody consoles their forlorn best buddy by labelling him “a lonely ugly arsehole”; a rock star swears repeatedly on children’s television and local radio without being interrupted; and the UK’s prime minister is introduced to a Downing Street staffer named Terrence, and immediately remarks, “Had an uncle called Terrence
 Hated him
 He was a pervert
”
    It’s a rare treat to see people in Love Actually who seem to get on with each other 
Admittedly, this kind of non sequitur from a high-level politician no longer seems quite so far-fetched now that Boris Johnson is the UK’s foreign secretary, but the film’s steady stream of bile does leave a nasty taste in the mouth
 Within a single four-minute stretch, one character has been named “the worst DJ in the world”, another “the ugliest man in the world”, and a Christmas single has been described as “the worst record” ever made
 As the Black-Eyed Peas and Justin Timberlake put it a few months before the film was released, where is the love
Martin Freeman

The only strand in which two characters are vaguely civilised to each other is the one which has two body doubles (Martin Freeman and Joanna Page) exchanging pleasantries while they’re naked and acting out sex scenes on a film set
 It’s a rare treat to see people in Love Actually who seem to get on with each other, but even they don’t discuss anything more meaningful than the traffic on the way to work, so you wouldn’t put money on their having a future together
And when one character does attempt to open up and say something personal, the response is bizarre
 At the start of the film, the recently widowed Daniel (Liam Neeson) phones his friend Karen (Emma Thompson), but she immediately cuts him off
 “Doesn’t mean that I’m not terribly concerned that your wife just died,” she adds, laying on the irony so thickly that you might assume that Daniel’s wife had suffered nothing worse than a mild headache
 This cruel and unusual punishment gets even more brutal when he breaks down in tears
 Karen’s reaction: “Get a grip
 People hate sissies
 No one’s ever going to shag you if you cry all the time
” Wow
 With friends like her, who needs internet trolls
Emma Thomspon
Many of the characters, such as Karen (Emma Thompson), utter barbs, body-shaming comments and insults (Credit: Alamy)
On the other hand, maybe Karen has a point
 By the end of the film, Daniel has hooked up with a Claudia Schiffer lookalike (played by Claudia Schiffer), so apparently the grieving process needn’t last more than a few weeks
 Similarly, Jamie proposes to Aurelia a mere month after he caught his previous girlfriend in bed with his own brother, so heartbreak isn’t a big deal, either, as far as Curtis is concerned
So what is love, actually
 According to the film, it’s an instant infatuation, it has nothing to do with being able to communicate, and it vanishes in no time
 As fun as the Rose Nose Day reunion is bound to be, then, it’s hard to care whether any of the film’s couples are still together
 If they’d broken up, they would all have moved on within weeks, anyway
Rarely have silent hands spoken so loudly
 A photo captured in the Oval Office this week of US President Donald Trump sitting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has gone viral on social media – not because of anything explicitly stated during that meeting, but as a result instead of the mute dialogue that appears to take place between the two leaders’ hands
 Caught in the millisecond before Trudeau responds to Trump’s invitation to shake hands, the image freezes the pair in what seems instead like a withering rebuff
    The fact that Trudeau heartily accepted Trump’s overture hardly mattered 
In the fiction of the photo, Trump’s jilted palm is left awkwardly hanging while Trudeau’s hands remain forever folded on his lap – a snub that appears amplified by the quizzical look on the prime minister’s face
 The fact that Trudeau, barely a blink later, heartily accepted Trump’s overture hardly mattered; the memes had already been written and the photo had already seeped its way into every corner of Facebook and Twitter
Not since the mid 17th Century and the publication in 1644 of the English physician John Bulwer’s eccentric tome Chirologia: Or the Naturall Language of the Hand, Composed of the Speaking Motions, and Discoursing Gestures Thereof, has so much attention been lavished on the secret grammar of pinkies and thumbs
 Accepting a challenge posed by the philosopher Francis Bacon a century earlier, Bulwer set about to decode the mysterious language of the fingers and single-handedly invented the science of 'chirology’
An illustration from Chirologia by John Bulwer (Credit: Wikipedia)
An esoteric illustration included in Bulwer’s book, or what he christened his ‘chyrogram’, is among the more intriguing visual documents of the age and sheds curious light on the Trump/Trudeau photo when placed alongside it
 Bulwer’s chirogram is intended to provide a handy glossary on the unspoken significance of typical gestures by attaching to each a simple deciphering phrase
 Beside the hieroglyph of clasped palms and intertwined fingers -- the one most closely resembling the body language exhibited by Prime Minister Trudeau in the photo – Bulwer has scribbled the Latin phrase “Tristi animi signo”, or “a sad sign of the mind”
Seen through the strange lens of Bulwer’s Chirologia, Trudeau is not exhibiting disdain, insolence, or defiance but rather a sort of psychological dejection
 As for how we should interpret President’s Trump’s own idiosyncratic gesture – a hand outstretched towards his guest with the palm facing oddly upwards, rather than to the side as one might expect from a conventional handshake, as if expecting something to drop inside it – Bulwer is mute
 His chirogram is, like many in the world’s media, lost for words
Fashions on the catwalk can seem remote at times – but they set the trends that filter down through the fashion press and social media, into our wardrobes and onto the streets
 So while you might not find yourself wearing Perspex trousers on your commute to work, or relaxing at home in a crystal-studded tracksuit, these looks and styles from the runway shows will shape what’s chic for women and men in 2017

There’s a distinctly ‘80s feel about the new big-shoulder proportions emerging in menswear for 2017 – it’s a look that is playful, exaggerated and just a little power dressy
 Bombers, suit jackets and overcoats are all looking broad and boxy, giving the wearer immediate swagger
 Brands going for the strong-shouldered look include Lanvin, E Tautz, JW Anderson and Balenciaga, whose new designer Demna Gvasalia unleashed the look at Paris fashion week last June
 And not forgetting the bold stripy blazer with outsized shoulders by Vivienne Westwood

It’s a familiar and ongoing feud: baby boomers in one corner and millennials in the other
 It seems the two generations are constantly at each other’s throats
 Less familiar, though, is any mention of that other generation, the one born in between the boomers and the Millennials
 Whatever happened to Generation X
 Where has it been, that lost generation of people now aged between 35 and 55, first identified back in 1991 by author Douglas Coupland
 How has it evolved, and what, if anything, can we learn from it today
Those were the questions that occurred to British Gen X-er Tiffanie Darke, whose book Now We Are 40: Whatever Happened to Generation X
 has just been published
 Working in the media, she would attend regular meetings with advertising agencies
 “They were completely obsessed with these two groups,” Darke tells BBC Culture
 “The job-for-life boomers with good pensions, who are rich in both time and cash, and the anxious millennials who are financially less secure, but tech-savvy
” After a while, she began to think: “Hang on, what about me
 What about the in-between generation
”
Tiffanie Darke

Back at the start of the 1990s, Darke was doing a ‘McJob’, working in a pizza restaurant to raise money in order to travel around India
 Coupland’s book Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture “articulated exactly who I was,” she recalls
 The book characterised the Gen X-ers as listless, cynical and anti-establishment – characteristics that resonated not only with Darke and her friends but millions of others around the world
 The ‘loadsamoney’ culture was seen as uncool and uncouth by the Gen Xers, who went travelling to broaden their minds, favoured jobs in creative industries over the more ‘yuppy’ sectors, and gave birth to rave culture, the movement fuelled by techno music and – in part but not completely – the drug MDMA, that swept through Britain in the late 1980s and early ‘90s
 It was the “3rd Summer of Love”, declared the magazine I was working on at the time, The Face – with waifish newcomer Kate Moss on its cover
Ravey days 
Darke was at the centre of that culture, and remembers it primarily for its loved-up, hedonistic joyfulness and sense of inclusivity – it appealed across all boundaries of class, race, gender and sexuality
 She was even present at the impromptu, now notorious all-weekend rave at Castlemorton, Worcestershire, which was eventually shut down by police
 It was a cool, rebellious culture, and one based on a “liberal, egalitarian mindset” she says: “At a rave you would talk to anyone, everyone was equally valid – crusties and travellers would be there, plumbers, homosexuality was celebrated, black music was celebrated
 And it evolved organically and slowly,” says Darke
    It was a pre-digital time, so in order to meet up you had to actually be there physically – Tiffanie Darke  
“It was a pre-digital time, so in order to meet up you had to actually be there physically, at that bus shelter, in that field or warehouse
” In 1994 the UK government passed the Criminal Justice Bill, which made the spontaneous gatherings illegal
 But this just spawned more organised, monetised events, says Darke
 “The scene became very mainstream, it tore through the whole country
 It was even credited with putting an end to football hooliganism once it had reached the terraces
”
The Face

Still, the party continued throughout the 1990s, with grunge music in the United States and, in Britain, Britpop, Brit Art, the rise of the ladette and Cool Britannia
 Vanity Fair declared: “London Swings Again
” The reason the Gen-X sensibility was strong on tolerant values, and evolved so organically and successfully, in Darke’s view, was because it was based on real connections and hard-fought experiences
 “You had to put real time and effort into belonging to the scene
 Now with the internet and social media it’s too easy, too promiscuous, you can join and leave 20 tribes in an hour,” she says
 “No wonder millennials are having a huge identity crisis
” Hence the rise in “slow artisanal crafts, like cross stitch or cheese making or micro brewing
 It’s a counterpoint to fast technology
”
Though a “blessed time” it was not always rosy in the Gen-X garden, and Darke also describes in her book how women in particular were “cannon fodder” in the evolving story of work/life balance (or lack of it, in most cases) and to some extent also in changing gender politics
 Nor does she gloss over the sometimes harsh realities of life as a middle-aged Gen Xer
 But she is adamant that her generation is or certainly should be “giving back
”
Reality Bites

In Darke’s opinion, Generation Xers should be on a mission to provide a “bridge” between millennials and boomers, especially now that it has largely gone from being anti-establishment to being part of it
 Generation X can play a healing role and help promote tolerance, is Darke’s message
 “We all need to remember what was important in the pre-digital world, and before the toxic smartphone culture
 I’m as guilty as anyone of that, it’s alluring and addictive, but it’s important to look up
”
All grown up
Tiffanie Darke’s appraisal of the Gen-X story is convincing and passionately expressed
 But how does the original creator of the term Generation X see its evolution – and where we are now
 Canadian author and artist Douglas Coupland is now 55 and so at the more senior end of the generation he wrote about all those years ago
 In his recent book of essays Bit Rot, Coupland writes: “While I may sometimes miss my pre-internet brain, I certainly don’t want it back
”
    Once we go, there’ll be no living memory of the analogue era – Douglas Coupland 
What does he or doesn’t he miss about it
 “I’m not being coy: I don’t remember it,” he tells BBC Culture
 “I started forgetting it about two years ago and now it’s all gone
 Sometimes I can trick my brain into thinking it’s the 20th Century by reading a book, but the moment I stop, I’m right back to here
” Though the fact that Gen X straddles the analogue and digital eras is, he says: “A sacred trust
 Once we go, there’ll be no living memory of the analogue era
”
So does he think that algorithmic culture has surpassed or will surpass human intuition
 “Actually, yes
 I know you’re supposed to say ‘no’ and cheer, ‘Yay humanity
’ But intuition is doomed
” Having been artist-in-residence at the Google Cultural Institute, he gained an idea of “the magnitude of it all
 If we’re alone in the universe, then it’s by far the largest thing ever built in the universe
”
Douglas Coupland

So how would he describe Generation X’s trajectory
 “I’ve never discussed Gen X that way, but I like what Tiffanie Darke has done
 It’s as good as it gets with generational observation; she’s crazy smart,” Coupland says
 “Conceptually, Gen X went from being the bash-it-with-a-stick piñata generation to being the serious generation that is heir to the greatest generation – my parents’
 Boomers haven’t changed a bit
 In as much as there is a Gen X, it’s paying for school bills for their kids and nursing care for their parents
 There’s not much free time to be either pro or anti-establishment
 They’re too busy working themselves into the grave
”
Coupland feels “neutral” about millennials, he says
 “I will say that pretty much everything they say about millennials is what they said about X except that millennials seem unable to cope when things don’t go their way
” And does he envisage our culture accelerating at the same pace it has been in the past few decades
 “Yes, faster actually
 Data is the new time
 The Cloud is the new infinity
 It’s all really happening right in front of your face
”
But we certainly shouldn’t be afraid of what the future holds, in his view
 “No
 Things are actually pretty good right now,” he says
 “We’re just conditioned to using alarmism as our default setting
 I’m not in the least bit worried, nor should you be
” His optimism may be be less evangelical than Tiffanie Darke’s, but it is no less persuasive  – and soothing
 As someone who has been described as “clairvoyant”, what does Douglas Coupland think the future holds for Gen X
 “A really good bottle of Pinot Gris, a comfortable bed, good wi-fi, and nobody around to bug them
”
A little boy wearing a tux stole the show at last year’s Oscars
 In Room, he had given a heartbreaking performance as the child of a young woman who had been kidnapped as a teenager and imprisoned for years in a shed
 The little boy’s character had been born into captivity and had never known life outside the confines of this backyard prison
 It was a performance that required a tremendous depth of feeling from this juvenile actor, Jacob Tremblay, who was only nine years old when he attended the Oscars ceremony
His role had required actorly imagination too
 Childhood is all about discoveries and firsts, but Tremblay’s character, when finally freed, experiences all of them at once, having thought the shed was the entire world
 To have the ability to reflect on what it means to have childhood wonder while still being a child is an extraordinary thing
 It requires an empathetic insight into a character that only the finest actors possess
(Credit: Alamy)
Jacob Tremblay was universally praised by critics for his performance in Room, yet there was never serious discussion of him being nominated (Credit: Alamy)
But Jacob Tremblay was not nominated for his performance in Room, and his role at the Oscars ceremony, though much beloved, was largely ornamental
 He gave his co-star Brie Larsen a high-five when her name was read out in the best actress category; he told host Chris Rock, “I loved you in Madagascar
”; he craned his neck to get a better look when the Star Wars droids BB-8, R2-D2 and C-3PO took the stage
 He was regarded for his cuteness rather than his talent
 And he is exactly why the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences needs to reinstitute the Academy Juvenile Award, with which they honoured performers under the age of 18 from 1935 to 1961
Oscar nominations for child actors in the current competitive categories are rare
 This year, Sunny Pawar, the young performer who plays a child separated from his parents in the film Lion, gives that movie much of its emotional punch
 When screenwriter Luke Davies accepted the Bafta Award for best adapted screenplay for Lion, he called Pawar “a discovery for the ages” – and yet, like Tremblay, Pawar was also passed over for a nomination
    Hollywood needs to recognise age is not a prerequisite for a great performance
Even when children are nominated in the competitive Academy Awards acting categories they rarely win
 The youngest best actor nominee was nine-year-old Jackie Cooper for Skippy, while the youngest winner was Adrien Brody, at age 29, for The Pianist
 The youngest best actress nominee was nine-year-old Quvenzhané Wallis for Beasts of the Southern Wild, while the youngest winner was 21-year-old Marlee Matlin for Children of a Lesser God

The supporting actor category follows the same trend, with eight-year-old Justin Henry being the youngest nominee for his tear-jerking turn in Kramer vs Kramer, while Timothy Hutton, at 20, was the youngest winner, for Ordinary People
 The supporting categories give much greater allowance to child performers, however: also nominated for supporting actor were 11-year-old Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense), 11-year-old Brandon De Wilde (Shane), 16-year-old Jack Wild for Oliver
 and 17-year-old Sal Mineo for Rebel Without a Cause

Tatum O’Neal, who won her Oscar for best supporting actress in 1974 at the age of 10, remains the youngest performer to win an Academy Award (Credit: Alamy)
Best supporting actress gave us three exceptions to the rule: 10-year-old Tatum O’Neil, 11-year-old Anna Paquin and 16-year-old Patty Duke all collected Oscar statuettes, with another seven aged 15 or under picking up nominations
 The implication is clear: the Academy is more willing to recognise the artistry of child performers in a supporting capacity, suggesting there’s resistance to the idea of children carrying a film entirely
 Hollywood needs to come to grips with the idea that age is not a prerequisite for a great performance, and bringing back the Academy Juvenile Award would help reaffirm the idea of child actors as artists
‘Never work with animals or children’
From 1935 to 1961, this honour, a seven-inch version of the 13
5in (34
29cm) statuette, was presented to child actors such as Deanna Durbin, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Margaret O’Brien, Claude Jarman Jr, Bobby Driscoll, Hayley Mills and, of course, Shirley Temple
 Many people’s perception of Temple – that she was simply a cute kid playing cute kids at whom adults could smile and say ‘Awwww’ – may have forever tarnished the idea of the ‘child star’
 But that’s unfair to Temple, who did much more than dance in wooden clogs or sing The Good Ship Lollipop
 Her tap-dance choreography with legendary hoofer Bill Bojangles Robinson in The Little Colonel was Eleanor Powell-calibre
 She spent six months learning Mandarin phrases for her role in Stowaway
 And as an abductee in Heidi, she’s genuinely moving
    Outside the US, children have been a staple in prestigious films by major auteurs
The idea that cuteness is children’s greatest cinematic virtue is one that Hollywood hasn’t really been able to shake
 Outside the US, children have been a staple in prestigious films by auteurs like De Sica, Truffaut, Tarkovsky, Oshima, Malle, Buñuel, Bergman and Kiarostami – Jean-Pierre Leaud in Truffaut’s The 400 Blows should be a definitive rebuke of the idea child performers can’t be more than cute
 But WC Fields’ famous quote “Never work with animals or children” – the implication being that either they’re not true professionals or will upstage their adult co-stars – has long been a guiding mantra for the industry

How many great Hollywood auteurs have built their films around striking child performances
 From Hitchcock, Hawks, or Huston the idea is almost unthinkable
 John Ford is the biggest exception, by building his 1941 best picture winner How Green Was My Valley around 12-year-old Roddy McDowall, whose performance, a masterful study of grief, disproves the idea that child actors can’t go deep
 In more recent decades Spielberg went further, building multiple films around children and children’s perspectives on the world
 And even Woody Allen, that paragon of adult wit and sophistication, created some of his most memorable moments onscreen via child actors in Annie Hall and Radio Days
The best of youth
So why did the Academy stop issuing the Juvenile Award in the first place
 There are several recurring arguments for the devaluation of child actors’ performances
 There’s the idea that children don’t have to overcome the self-consciousness and self-doubt that can be a hurdle for adult actors to overcome the fear of judgment
 It’s an argument that suggests anxiety is a key ingredient for a great performance; a child actor experiences none of the fear of criticism an adult faces, therefore there are no stakes
    Natalie Wood’s mother tore the wings off a live butterfly to make her cry on set
It’s no coincidence that the last time the Juvenile Award was given was 1961, right at the moment that the Academy’s ranks started to swell with actors committed to Stanislavski, Adler and The Method
 For many of these devotees, the challenge of acting is that you have to overcome a fully developed sense of self to inhabit someone else
 That means ‘staying in character’ or doing other elaborate acting exercises

Child performers in films by international arthouse auteurs have often drawn more critical respect than child actors in Hollywood (Credit: Criterion Collection)
Even overlooking how active children’s imaginations are and can therefore be as ‘Method’ as adults, some child actors did have Method-style preparation, if unwillingly
 Natalie Wood’s mother would prepare her daughter – without her daughter’s consent – for sad scenes in the refugee drama Tomorrow Is Forever by recalling the time she saw their dog run over by a car, and, on one occasion Wood’s biographer Suzanne Finstad recalls, even took out from a jar a live butterfly and tore off its wings in front of her

Jackie Cooper was one of the most acclaimed child actors in Hollywood history for his role in The Champ (Credit: MGM)
The Academy has always had a preference for showy performances bordering on the hysterical
 Maybe, by contrast, there’s a feeling that children can only play themselves
 But then how do you account for nine-year-old Jackie Cooper’s famous meltdown in The Champ – primal wails and hair pulling – when he learns his father has died
 And if you feel the opposite is true, that it’s hard for children to be understated and not mug for the camera, you need to see The Black Stallion, where 11-year-old Kelly Reno, as a shipwrecked child alone on an island with only an equine companion, delivers a performance so minimalist he could have been a muse for Robert Bresson
 Don’t think children can be villainous
 Take a look at Douglas Silva as the murderous pre-teen gangster L’il Ze in City of God
 But surely a child can never play anything but a child, right
 Then you haven’t seen Haley Joel Osment in AI: Artificial Intelligence portray a robot who’s playing the role of a child for a childless mother
 The entire performance is a child actor’s detached commentary on the nature of not just childhood but humanity itself
(Credit: Alamy)
The moment where Douglas Silva’s pint-sized gangster Lil Zé first becomes a murderer is one of the most chilling in all of film (Credit: Alamy)
Perhaps irony is the biggest test of a child actor’s gifts
 But look at how Macaulay Culkin disappears into the role of Kevin McAllister in Home Alone while also bringing a self-aware dimension to it
 In the film, Culkin is asked to not only play a child but play the embodiment of a universal human fantasy, then show the downside of that fantasy when it’s fulfilled
 When he and possibly murderous snow-shoveling neighbour Roberts Blossom sit together in a church pew and discuss their shared loneliness, we see a child experiencing the kind of depression about being alone at Christmas almost exclusively reserved for adults
The Academy Awards are determined by the campaigns that are mounted and the narratives that are created by publicists and studio marketing executives as much as by anything else, and children, though capable of acting at its best, usually can’t deliver on this part of the Oscar process, whether because of school or family commitments
 That’s yet another reason why so few child performers are nominated in the competitive categories
 But the Academy needs to bring back the Juvenile Award to address these oversights
Refusing to acknowledge the greatness of child performers is what’s truly childish
Clad in the ancient robes of a Shaolin monk and hoisted balletically on one foot, an instructor in Wushu, a modern form of traditional kung fu, rises above a tattered scrap of snow on a hilltop west of Kabul
 What is truly remarkable about her statuesque stance (captured in a recent photo) isn’t merely its athletic grace or poetic air
 Flanked on either side by a retinue of crouching students poised for combat, the female instructor strikes a formidable pose that is, in fact, socially audacious – one in elegant defiance of what is typically expected of her gender in Afghanistan

Undeterred by those locals who believe practising the Chinese martial art is unbecoming of women, 20-year-old Sima Azimi (who learned Wushu in Iran) is committed to broadening the prospects of Afghan girls
 While it is tempting to read in the Samsonian thrust of Azimi’s outward-stretching arms a metaphor for the shoving-over of chauvinistic norms, the allure of her fearless physique may be invigorated by even subtler symbolism
Consciously or not, our eyes respond to a geometry in Azimi’s pose, as her body unexpectedly assumes the shape of a hexagram – a six-pointed star comprised of two overlapping triangles oriented in opposite directions
 The upside-down triangle that is created by Azimi’s horizontally outstretched arms down to her planted foot is easy enough to discern
 Superimposed against that, an upwards-pointing triangle is traceable from Azimi’s head through the slanting torsos of the two students nearest to her on either side – their bent thighs suggesting the base of the shape
(Credit: Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York)
Sculptures of Nataraja, such as this one from the 11th Century, have been described as an amalgam of femininity and masculinity (Credit: Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York)
In ancient Asian artwork, the hexagram symbolised the harmonious fusion of masculinity (represented by the upwards-pointing triangle) and femininity (the downwards-pointing triangle)
 Among the most hypnotic embodiments of that merging of opposites is a famous depiction of the Hindu deity Shiva in the guise of Nataraja (the Lord of the Dance), whose carefully choreographed limbs echo the shape of the hexagram
 Placed alongside Nataraja, the image of Azimi and her students is suddenly loaded with iconoclastic potential
 Set in an otherworldly landscape of desert and snow, the photo announces the birth of a new and powerful cosmic talent with which the universe must contend: the indomitable Ladies of the Dance
A mystery surrounding one of John Constable's most emotionally-charged landscapes may finally have been solved – by a meteorologist
Constable, one of Britain's most celebrated landscape painters, considered the vast, 2m-wide Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows – currently on display at the Salisbury Museum, after which it travels to the National Galleries of Scotland – his greatest work
 He first exhibited it in 1831 while grieving the loss of Maria Bicknell, his beloved wife and mother of his seven children
 The couple had spent part of their honeymoon in Salisbury, and the town was also the home of Constable's best friend, the Archdeacon John Fisher
Art historians have long interpreted the painting's turbulent sky as a reflection of Constable's intense and tumultuous mourning, its brooding storm clouds pierced by a perfect rainbow symbolising hope and happy memories

But there is one problem with this interpretation: recent research has shown that, in all probability, Constable's original painting did not include a rainbow
 He added it later
    Constable had a real knowledge of meteorology – probably as good as any meteorologist at that time – John Thornes 
Why did he change his masterpiece
 Professor John Thornes, professor of applied meteorology at the University of Birmingham, believes he has found an answer by dating the rainbow using modern computer software
 His theory is that Constable painted it in to commemorate his friendship with Fisher, who died about a year after the work was first displayed
“Constable had a real knowledge of meteorology – probably as good as any contemporary meteorologist at that time,” Thornes says
 “He studied rainbow science and had some quite mathematical friends who we think taught him about rainbows
”
Rainbow connection
Given Constable's expertise, Thornes was surprised to find that the rainbow could not have appeared while Constable first painted Salisbury Cathedral
 Rainbows can be dated very precisely based on their position in relation to the sun, and Thornes' analysis revealed that this one would have graced the sky on 25 August 1832 – the date of Fisher's death
 The end of the rainbow touches Fisher's house
Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows
According to recent investigations, John Constable did not originally include the rainbow shown here in his painting Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows (Credit: Tate)
“It's pretty obvious that Constable put the rainbow in as a commemoration of the life of his best friend,” Thornes says
 “This explains why the rainbow doesn't fit into the painting – it's a commemorative symbol
”
There is other evidence that the rainbow was added later
 The curator Amy Concannon at the Tate, which acquired the painting for £23
1 million in 2013, inspected the canvas after the purchase
 She noticed that the rainbow was sitting on top of the other layers of paint and had not been part of the original composition
    Constable was one of those artists who never thought anything was quite good enough – Amy Concannon 
Concannon also researched the reaction of critics to the work when it was first displayed at the Royal Academy in 1831
 While they commented in detail on the sky and clouds, none of them mentioned a rainbow
 However, when Salisbury Cathedral was exhibited again in Birmingham in 1834, critics reacted to the rainbow, suggesting that the painting had been modified
“I think his theory is very plausible,” says Concannon
 “Constable was one of those artists who never thought anything was quite good enough; he was plagued by self-doubt
 So even though the painting had been exhibited, he took it back to his studio and continued working on it
”
Constable himself was apparently pleased with the changes
 “I am sure I have much increased its power and effect
 I have no doubt of this picture being my best now,” he wrote to a friend before the Birmingham exhibition

Does the rainbow's newly revealed significance mean the painting is really about friendship and loyalty, rather than love and grief
 Concannon at the Tate says that it may be both
 In fact, she thinks the painting is a reflection of several emotional and political upheavals that were affecting the artist
 They show the more complex side of a painter often associated with images of rural idyll
Many of Constable's works feature bucolic scenes of meadows and horse-drawn carts, such as The Hay Wain, which has been voted Britain's second-favourite painting
 But this chocolate-box reputation belies the turmoil that drove Constable to paint Salisbury Cathedral
Constable had been devoted to his wife, moving his large family to the seaside and to Hampstead in the hope that fresh air would improve her ailing health
 After she died from tuberculosis in 1828, he deeply mourned the loss of his “departed Angel”, as he called her in a letter to his brother
 Archdeacon Fisher sheltered him in his house during this period of grief, and the archdeacon’s own death in 1832 would have been another emotional blow
Threats on the horizon
At the same time, political and religious change threatened Constable's conservative outlook
 Reform activists were questioning the Church's central role in British life and its closeness to parliament – the Church of England was, and remains, the state church and its bishops sit in the House of Lords
 Reformers wanted to curb its power and separate church and state; Fisher and Constable opposed the reformers
 They discussed how to capture the conflict artistically, with Fisher eventually writing to Constable that a church under a cloud would be the best option
“So the reformers were the clouds that threatened the Church,” Concannon says
 “It seems very clear to me that it's a painting about politics
”
1822 cloud study

After Fisher died, Constable possibly added the rainbow not only to honour his friend's memory, but also to express a slightly more optimistic view of the political situation, according to Concannon
“It's an act of acknowledgement of his friendship, but also a sign of hope that the future – for himself personally, and perhaps for the Church – wouldn't always be as rocky and tumultuous as the previous years had been
 Maybe the passing of his friend put things into perspective for him,” Concannon says
    When you see a rainbow in the sky, you can date the painting – Thornes 
Whatever the precise symbolism of the painting, Constable went to great lengths to depict the rainbow so accurately that it could be dated
 According to Thornes, Constable did not paint the rainbow on the day of his friend's death, but rather recreated it later using his knowledge of solar geometry, meaning the position of the rainbow in relation to the sun
 This made it possible for Thornes to determine when it would have appeared
 The meteorologist used recently developed software that is able to calculate the solar geometry of any rainbow at Salisbury for any day of the year
“The rainbow is a bit like a clock,” Thornes says
 “When you see a rainbow in the sky, you can date it if you've got something to compare it with” – much like a sun dial
 “In this case, we've got the cathedral, so we know exactly where the sun would have to be for a rainbow like that to occur
”

Constable had a passion for understanding the science of the skies that inspired his art
 Between 1820 and 1822, when he was living at Hampstead, he painted more than 100 studies of the sky, including detailed oil sketches of clouds accompanied by notes on the time of day and direction of the wind
 He also wrote about the geometry of rainbows and analysed their shapes and colours in diagrams
 Thornes says this sets Constable apart from other landscape artists such as Claude Monet and JMW Turner, who painted more intuitively
“Constable said we see nothing truly until we understand it,” he said
 “And the rainbow is a case in point
 You don't see a rainbow properly until you understand how it's formed
”
While Thornes may have solved the mystery of when and why Constable added the rainbow, other questions remain open
 Thornes' next ambition is to find out exactly how Constable recreated the correctly dated rainbow for his painting, possibly using a piece of string or scientific instruments
 Meanwhile, Concannon is hoping to uncover more about the political content of the painting and the public's reaction to it
“It's quite complicated, really, but that's why it's such a powerful painting – there's more to it than meets the eye,” Concannon says
 “There always is with Constable, but that picture says that more than any other

This isn’t a quirky television advertisement, nor is it an elaborate performance art piece
 Movement-minded art lovers are now taking exercise classes in New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and MoMA
 They dance to disco music or perform yoga poses while gazing at bronzes by Rodin and canvases from El Greco to Rauschenberg
It’s killing two birds with one stone: exercise your brain while increasing your heartrate
 And instead of merely listening to music, an audiobook, or watching TV, you can be surrounded by some of the world’s greatest art while performing your sun salutations
But these exercise programmes at museums also raise other questions: does blood-pumping activity sharpen your mental capacities and allow you to appreciate a work of art more than passively standing in front of it
 Does exercising in front of great art force you into a deeper interaction with a work of art
BBC Culture attended one of the Monica Bill Barnes Company’s dance classes at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to take a look
Seventy-five years ago, in February 1942, Europe’s most popular author committed suicide in a bungalow in the Brazilian town of Petrópolis, 10,000 km (6,200 miles) from his birthplace in Vienna
 In the year before his death, Stefan Zweig completed two contrasting studies – The World of Yesterday: Memoirs of a European, an elegy for a civilisation now consumed by war, and Brazil: Land of the Future, an optimistic portrait of a new world
 The story of these two books, and of the refugee who wrote them, offers a guide to the trap of nationalism and the trauma of exile
    Austria-Hungry provided Zweig with a template of cultural plurality in the face of nationalism
Zweig was born in 1881 into a prosperous and cultured Jewish family in Vienna, capital of the multi-ethnic Habsburg empire, where Austrians, Hungarians, Slavs and Jews, among many others, co-existed
 Their ruler was the polyglot Franz-Joseph I, who decreed at the start of his reign in 1867 that “All races of the empire have equal rights, and every race has an inviolable right to the preservation and use of its own nationality and language”
Franz-Joseph was a stiff-necked autocrat, and his reign should not be romanticised, but it provided Zweig with a template of cultural plurality at a time when Europe was consuming itself in nationalism
 His biographer George Prochnik notes that Zweig called for the foundation of an international university, with branches in every major European capital and a rotating exchange programme that would expose young people to other ethnicities and religions

Before settling in Brazil, Zweig lived for a while in Ossining, New York – where he was photographed in 1941 (Credit: Alamy)
Zweig began to write The World of Yesterday after leaving Austria in 1934, anticipating the Nazification of his homeland
 He completed the first draft in New York in summer 1941, and posted the final version, typed by his second wife Lotte Altmann, to his publisher the day before their joint suicide
 By then, the Habsburg empire had “vanished without trace”, he writes, and Vienna was “demoted to the status of a German provincial town”
 Zweig became stateless: “So I belong nowhere now, I am a stranger or at the most a guest everywhere”

Zweig’s memoir is illuminating in its portrait of the disorienting nature of exile
 In the cities in which Zweig had been celebrated, his books were now burnt; the golden era of “security and prosperity and comfort” had given way to revolution, economic instability and nationalism, “the ultimate pestilence that has poisoned the flower of our European culture”
 Time itself was ruptured: “all the bridges are broken between today, yesterday and the day before yesterday”
Without a trace
One of Zweig’s greatest anxieties was the loss of his linguistic home
 He expressed “a secret and tormenting shame” that Nazi ideology was “conceived and drafted in the German language”
 Like the poet Paul Celan, who committed suicide in Paris, Zweig felt that the language of Schiller, Goethe and Rilke had been occupied by Nazism, and irredeemably deformed
 After moving to England, he felt “imprisoned in a language, which I cannot use”
    Zweig writes of a time you could visit India and the US without a passport or visa
In The World of Yesterday, Zweig describes the ease of borderless travel prior to 1914 – of visiting India and the US without the need for a passport or visa – a situation inconceivable to the interwar generation
 Now he, like all refugees, faced the humiliation of negotiating an unwieldy bureaucracy
 Zweig described his intense “Bureauphobia” as immigration officials demanded ever more proof of identity, and he joked to a fellow refugee that his job description was “Formerly writer, now expert in visas”

As Hitler’s forces spread across Europe, Zweig moved from his lodging in Bath in the UK to Ossining, New York
 There he was almost unknown to all but his fellow refugees, who lacked his connections and material comforts, and frequently appealed to his legendary generosity
 Zweig never felt at home in the US – he regarded Americanisation as the second destruction of European culture, after World War One – and hoped to return to Brazil, which enchanted him during a lecture tour in 1936

Brazil: Land of the Future is a lyrical celebration of a nation whose beauty and generosity profoundly impressed Zweig
 He was surprised and humbled by the country, and admonished himself for his ignorance and “European arrogance”
 Zweig outlines Brazil’s history, economy, culture and geography, but the real insight of the book comes from the perspective he gains about his own continent
    There is no colour-bar, no segregation, no arrogant classification – Zweig
Brazil becomes, in Zweig’s description, everything he would like Europe to be: sensual, intellectual, tranquil and averse to militarism and materialism
 (He even claims that Brazilians lack the European passion for sport – a bizarre assertion, even in 1941)
 Brazil is free of Europe’s “race fanatics”, its “frenzied scenes and mad ecstasies of hero-worship”, its “foolish nationalism and imperialism”, its “suicidal fury”

In its cadences and colours, Brazil was radically different from Zweig’s repressed image of Habsburg Vienna, but the beauty of its hybrid identity seemed to vindicate his outlook
 In Brazil, the descendants of African, Portuguese, German, Italian, Syrian and Japanese immigrants mixed freely: “all these different races live in fullest harmony with each other”
 Brazil teaches ‘civilised’ Europe how to be civilised: “Whereas our old world is more than ever ruled by the insane attempt to breed people racially pure, like race-horses and dogs, the Brazilian nation for centuries has been built upon the principle of a free and unsuppressed miscegenation
 It is moving to see children of all colours – chocolate, milk, and coffee – come out of their schools arm-in-arm… There is no colour-bar, no segregation, no arrogant classification
 for who here would boast of absolute racial purity
”
‘Paradise’
This paean proved hugely popular with the public, and thousands of Brazilians attended Zweig’s lectures, while his daily itinerary was printed in every major newspaper
 But the book was lambasted by critics: Prochnik notes that, for three days in a row, Brazil’s leading newspaper published withering reviews, accusing Zweig of ignoring the country’s industrial and modernist innovations

Zweig’s writing in praise of Brazil made him popular there – several locations are even named after him (Credit: Wikipedia/Eduardo P)
More controversial was Zweig’s fulsome praise for Brazil’s dictator, Getúlio Vargas
 In 1937, Vargas had declared the Estado Novo (New State), inspired by authoritarian rule in Portugal and Italy
 Vargas shut down Brazil’s congress and imprisoned left-wing intellectuals, some of whom assumed that Zweig had been paid for his praise, or at least offered a visa
 Vargas’ government had curtailed Jewish immigration on racial grounds – but made an exception for Zweig, due to his fame
This troubling episode reveals Zweig’s political naivety
 A pacifist and conciliator by nature, Zweig feared inciting hostility at a crucial moment (Vargas finally sided with the Allies in January 1942)
 Seeking seclusion, Stefan and Lotte ensconced themselves in the elegant former German settlement of Petrópolis, 40 miles (64 km) outside Rio
    Zweig believed in a world beyond borders, but he became defined by them
“It is Paradise”, wrote Zweig of the lush Alpine landscape, which “seems to be translated from the Austrian into a tropical language”
 Zweig sought to forget his old books and friendships, and seek “inner freedom”
 But at Carnival in Rio, he learned of Nazi advances in the Middle East and Asia, and a sense of doom descended
 Zweig felt he could never be free, or free from fear
 “Do you honestly believe that the Nazis will not come here
” he wrote
 “Nothing can stop them now
”
Zweig believed in a world beyond borders, but he became defined by them: “My inner crisis consists in that I am not able to identify myself with the me of my passport, the self of exile”
 This haunted Zweig (“We are just ghosts – or memories”), and he wrote in his suicide note of being “exhausted by long years of homeless wandering”
 Stefan and Lotte shared this resignation: “We have no present and no future… We decided, bound in love, not to leave each other”
In Petrópolis, I visited Zweig’s bungalow, which now serves as an “active museum”, according to Tristan Strobl, who works there on national service as an Austrian Holocaust Memorial Servant
 He showed me an interactive display of all the refugees that came to Brazil between 1933 and 1945, highlighting their contributions
 “This period was such a loss for the intellectual life of Europe”, says Tristan, “but for Brazil and the other countries that received these exiles, it was hugely positive”

Fountain of Apollo, VersaillesThe Palace of Versailles occupies 2,000 acres (8 sq km), more than twice the area of Manhattan’s Central Park
 But, then, the self-styled ‘Sun King’ was never less than overweeningly ambitious
 Louis XIV saw himself as the Apollo of his day, and the finest of the fountains created for the palace gardens when revamped by André Le Nôtre from 1662 was inspired by the idea of the Roman sun god rising from the sea at dawn on his light-bringing ride across the heavens

 But if the wind drops or the thermometer rises, it’s time to run as that innocuous nozzle sends seven tons of water shooting 460 ft (140m) into the Alpine sky at 120mph (200kph)

“I look for colours that… say something to me – that make a statement,” says Academy Award winning make-up designer Michèle Burke in this video
 “I look at the face or I look at the character, and I think ‘what is the first thing I want them to look at
’”
Burke has created such looks as Tom Cruise’s battered face in Vanilla Sky, Mike Myers’s bald-headed Dr Evil in Austin Powers and the ethereal bright-eyed Brad Pitt in Interview with the Vampire
 “I look at the totality of the person – the hair, the skin tone,” she says
 “Who is this person going to be
”
She describes how she stumbled into the profession – “I didn’t know you could do something like this” – and how she picks the shades to suit a personality
 “If you played a character in a film that was distasteful, I might choose colours that are in the opposite spectrum, to make you look in discord, a little bit off
 Whereas if I wanted you to look appealing and gorgeous, I would choose warm, uplifting colours

 Although Ai Weiwei’s monumental new artwork is as light as air, its subject matter is heavy
Ai Weiwei is himself a refugee and in recent years he has turned his attention to the subject of displaced people
 In 2015, he wrapped the columns of Berlin’s Konzerthaus concert hall in hundreds of bright orange life vests
 He is currently working on a film, The Human Flow, which will be presented later this year
The installation of this new artwork in Prague is pointed: the government of the Czech Republic, like many other central European countries, has reacted angrily against the influx of refugees since 2015 and the EU’s system of quotas to accept them
 "I say clearly that I don't want even a single refugee in the Czech Republic, not even temporarily," Deputy Prime Minister Andrej Babis wrote in August 2015
As he walks around the new work, Ai tells Rob Cameron that the Czech government’s attitude is “by any means not acceptable because it’s morally wrong
 It’s short-sighted
 It’s a coward’s behavior
”
“In this time of uncertainty, we need more tolerance, compassion and trust for each other since we all are one
 Otherwise, humanity will face an even bigger crisis” Ai added in a statement
Terrence Malick made a masterpiece, Days of Heaven, nearly 40 years ago, and that film’s outsized shadow has unfairly haunted his career ever since
 What could possibly measure up
 Today the film remains as eloquent as ever, timeless and purely Malick
 A romantic triangle plays out in a drama of love, jealousy, desire and treachery against the visually stunning landscape of an early 20th Century Texas farm, the story shaped by a young girl’s voiceover
It’s as contemporary as a film shot five years ago can be
Malick didn’t make another movie for 20 years, then returned with a quickening pace
 But in his most recent work, the approach derived from Days of Heaven has curdled
 To the Wonder (2013) and Knight of Cups (2016) are poetic essays, full of stunning imagery and philosophical questions in voiceover
 But even judged as poetry they are more vapid than effective, full of posing and pouting
 To The Wonder could play as spot-on self-parody, as a morose Ben Affleck and his French bride wander through the open spaces of Oklahoma, speaking overblown lines
 Knight of Cups is nearly unwatchable, with Christian Bale as a degenerate Hollywood screenwriter who floats though clichéd party scenes and ponders daddy issues
The new drama, Song to Song, is lesser Malick compared to his finest work, but succeeds in being smart and engaging for at least its first half
 In To the Wonder and Knight of Cups, characters vanish under all that puffed-up philosophising
 Song to Song tethers itself to reality with another romantic triangle, this time set against the contemporary backdrop of the music scene in Austin, Texas
 Or as contemporary as a film shot five years ago can be
 Taking years with his edits is another Malick trademark
Rooney Mara is the central figure, Faye, a would-be musician
 She sleeps with Cook, a record producer played by Michael Fassbender, hoping to further her career
 They knowingly use each other, until she falls for Ryan Gosling as BV, a songwriter who is Cook’s protégé at first, but who breaks with him after Cook steals his copyrights
 Faye hides her continuing relationship with Cook from her new love, creating a swirl of ethical dilemmas
The actors make these characters vivid, within a structure that is recognisably Malick’s
 Faye describes the strategy in voiceover: “I thought we could just roll and tumble, live from song to song, kiss to kiss
” The film mirrors that approach
 It is built on fragments, disconnected moments of time, seen from various characters’ perspectives and with more voiceover than dialogue
 There are Faye and Cook in his bedroom, Faye and BV in one of a series of opulent places she housesits (the shifting locations create a sense of a character adrift)
 Backstage at concerts, Cook stands next to Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine or chats over a glass of wine with Iggy Pop
 Eventually, BV questions Faye about her relationship with Cook
 She responds with a series of lies
 Although Faye realizes that living song to song cannot work forever, the film uses the tactic to good effect, piecing together a cogent story of love and deception
To the wonder
Malick’s typical nature imagery, used as interstitial scenes and easily parodied, is replaced here by scenes of music festivals, including SXSW and the Austin City Limits Festival
 The music turns out to be no more than set decoration, despite a parade of familiar names and faces
 We rarely hear more than a few lines of any performance: the Black Lips here, Iggy Pop there
 Once, Faye turns up on stage with a guitar but we never hear a lick
 We can only guess what kind of music BV writes – quasi-country maybe
 Among many, Patti Smith’s is the only one that matters
 She plays a version of her down-to-earth self, giving Faye advice and singing My Blakean Year
Emmanuel Lubezki (known for Gravity, Birdman and The Revenant) has been Malick’s cinematographer since The New World (2005)
 Here he gives Austin a gleaming look, yet the visuals never become an overwhelming distraction
The inflated bad-poetry style of weaker Malick films is minimised  
Fassbender and Gosling are great fits for the film, each adding the energy and charisma that is so often missing from Malick’s work
 Fassbender brings honesty to his character’s transparently evil, self-destructive nature
 Gosling is charmingly boyish, and convincing when it turns out BV is not as naive as he first appears
Mara is another story
 She starts out well enough, her hair in a schoolgirl ponytail that disguises Faye’s steely ambition
 As the film goes on, Mara (rather than her character) becomes one-note and tiresome
 We lose patience with Faye just when we should be empathising with her
In the second half of Song to Song, Malick expands the circle of characters
 Cook takes up with a waitress played by Natalie Portman, who brings a sad elegance to an underwritten role
 BV deals, in short episodes, with his family (Linda Emond as his mother and Tom Sturridge as his brother), a new love played by Cate Blanchett, and an ex-girlfriend, played by the musician Lykke Li
 Her scenes with Gosling are strong, and include a lively scene in which they dance to Del Shannon’s Runaway
Responses to the new film at its SXSW premiere recently were mostly vicious
Despite its weaknesses, Song to Song stands as Malick’s best since The Tree of Life, (2011), an eloquent memory piece about family and loss that largely worked
 Responses to the new film when it premiered at SXSW recently were mostly vicious, almost annoyed at Malick for no longer being his Days of Heaven self, an unreasonable standard
 The only way to judge him is on his own, 21st Century, experimental terms
Those terms come sharply into focus when you consider that the original title of Song to Song was Weightless, which, Malick said at SXSW, comes from Virginia Woolf
 In her novel The Waves, a character wonders how to go on “without a self, weightless and visionless, through a world weightless, without illusion
” Like Malick’s recent work, The Waves is more a poem than a story
 Substitute voiceovers for literary monologues and you have an exact model of a Malick film
 And like Song to Song, Woolf’s novel raises the open-ended question of whether the fragments of a life can ever coalesce into a whole
The Waves is not Woolf’s most accessible or popular work, and Song to Song is not likely to be Malick’s
 But it reveals a true artist still at work
Disguised in a wig and sunglasses, the artist Jo Brocklehurst went undercover to draw some of the larger-than-life figures of London’s nightlife at fetish clubs and punk gigs
 But her extraordinary body of work – including portraits of everyone from Boy George to Billy Idol – has remained largely unknown
An exhibition of her work created from the 1960s up to her death in 2006, called Nobodies and Somebodies, may change that
 The show reveals an unparalleled window into the subversive underbelly of punk, as well as the first connective sparks between this local subculture and the international fashion world
“She was a true artist, the real deal, drawing every day of her life,” says Isabelle Bricknall, Brocklehurst’s close friend and co-curator of the exhibition
 “The objective was never money
 The art establishment at that time wouldn’t have touched punks with a ten-foot bargepole, but she saw something there
 She was ahead of her time

 Jo Brocklehurst captured her subjects in unguarded moments

A child prodigy, Brocklehurst was offered a scholarship to study at renowned Saint Martin’s School of Art at the tender age of 14
 She graduated four years later, by which time the staid traditions of fashion illustration, mainly tasteful renditions of Parisian haute couture, were no longer exciting
 Brocklehurst took her rigorous academic training and turned her attention to London’s seedy underworld, immersing herself in the nascevnt punk scene of the late 1960s and the fetish clubs where people were exploring alternative sexualities
Brocklehurst sported a wig and sunglasses, moving around stealthily to capture her subjects at their most unguarded moments
Brocklehurst frequented these overlooked corners of the city in disguise and with her sketchbook in hand, moving around stealthily to capture her subjects at their most unguarded moments
Her personal life was equally secretive
 Brocklehurst always refused to reveal her exact age, but it has been accepted she was born at some point in the 1930s, the illegitimate child of an affair between a senior political figure from Sri Lanka and an English mother
 She was so guarded about her background that many of her friends did not even realise her dual heritage
Brocklehurst immersed herself in the punk scene

Bright lights, big cities
She also had an uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time
 A tireless traveller, Brocklehurst spent extended periods in Berlin and New York, crossing paths with everyone from Siouxsie Sioux and Billy Idol to Andy Warhol and Keith Haring
 She even exhibited in the headline-grabbing 1980 exhibition at London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts, Women’s Images of Men, followed by successful gallery shows in the city in 1981 and 1982
 Whether immersed in the anti-establishment spirit of the 1960s, hanging around with the 1970s Pop artists in New York, a stalwart of the Blitz club kids scene in 1980s Soho, she was always observing, always recording – and always honing her craft
She became one of fashion’s best-kept secrets – Isabelle Bricknall
“Despite all that, she was never seduced by fame,” Bricknall says
 “Everyone knew who she was, and would try and jump in front of her and get their picture drawn in the clubs
 Even with the following generations, people like Alexander McQueen and John Galliano, who were around when Jo was a septuagenarian
 She became one of fashion’s best-kept secrets
 If you were really hip and happening, Jo would draw you
 The irony is that she never knew who the people were; she had no interest in celebrity
 It was usually up to me to identify who she’d drawn on one of her nights out
”
Brocklehurst is known for using wiry, fluid lines, contorted poses and theatrical gestures

Brocklehurst’s style is often linked to that of Egon Schiele: wiry, fluid lines used to describe the topography of the human form, contorted poses and theatrical gestures and luminous eyes that arrest the viewer with a cold and magisterial gaze
 But she arguably fits better into the lineage of 20th-Century documentary artists who placed their subjects first and their egos second
 Like Diane Arbus or Mary Ellen Mark, Brocklehurst shows an interest in those who lived their lives at the fringes of society, granting them the dignity they may never have been afforded elsewhere
Sunglasses at night
“She loved Leonora Carrington and Frida Kahlo, for example, because they were women of convinction
 They stepped outside the norms of their societies,” says Bricknall
 “She was aware of the importance of her gender in being a documentary artist, because there’s a certain trust afforded to women that means they can go places men can’t
 Even though she could be quite an intimidating presence – fabulous looking and a lady of mystery – people were drawn to her like a magnet
”
As records of the culture in which they were produced, the drawings offer a refreshingly personal antidote to the black-and-white photography of punk’s genesis you might find elsewhere
 Brocklehurst saw her subjects in pulsing, kaleidoscopic colour: the heat flushing their cheeks, thick veins winding up their forearms, lurid pink flesh that seems to throb
 It’s a visceral experience witnessing them up close, dragging the viewer into the din and heat of their underground world
 By isolating her subjects from the chaotic context of a club or a drag bar, she grants them a seductive subjectivity
 We're left to fill in the gaps, to construct our own debauched narratives for each of these weird and wonderful characters
“She saw her art as a sacred act – and if I say that to some people, their shutters come down, because it's not cool to think about it like that – but Jo was very spiritual
 She was drawing with sunglasses on, and I’d see her pick up her pencils or brushes and start making these initial marks in vibrant colours
 I asked her how she did that, and she explained that she saw auras around people
 On the fetish scene, she saw people as either angelic or demonic, and she'd represent that
”
Brocklehurst might come across like a classic British eccentric, but her prodigious abilities and relentless curiosity speak otherwise
 Her work isn’t just impressive for its refusal to patronise its subjects, but also for its playfulness and wit

A final series is displayed at the end of the exhibition, inspired by Alice in Wonderland – supposedly from after Brocklehurst returned from a stint in New York and felt compelled to reacquaint herself with a sense of Englishness
 Cream teas and summer fetes, however, this is not
 Brocklehurst offers a radical reimagining of the characters, the Queen of Hearts resplendent in an armour-like fetish gown
 At a time when the transgressive edges of London's nightlife are gradually eroding, let's hope Brocklehurst’s drawings, and the thrilling culture that went with it, don’t end up as relics of a bygone Britain

The jangle of car keys, a door slamming, the clatter of plates
 Ordinary, everyday sounds, which foley artist Alyson Dee Moore has to recreate in extraordinary ways
 “You may not know you’re hearing, but you’re hearing them,” she says in a video revealing how she creates the sound effects in films like The Matrix, The Dark Knight and Frozen
Moore has been a foley artist for more than 30 years, painstakingly recreating sound effects that are timed to match what’s happening on the screen
 “You shouldn’t notice it – it should just fit seamlessly
”
The video offers a glimpse inside Moore’s studio, which is “full of junk” – scuffed shoes, piles of plant pots, crutches leaning against the wall and shelves filled with coconut shells
 And there’s an insight into the process of making sounds like space helmets colliding (involving a pine cone) or knuckles cracking (using uncooked lasagne sheets)
 As Moore’s mixer Mary Jo Lang comments, “Foley is a unique kind of sound, because it’s bigger than life but it still sounds like life”
How the Moonlight composer creates music“With Moonlight, when I first read the screenplay… it just felt like a piece of poetry,” says the composer of the film’s score
 Nicholas Britell was nominated for an Academy Award for his work: in this video, he describes how he collaborated with its director Barry Jenkins
 “We said ‘what if we chopped and screwed the score
’” What seems to be warped moments of sound are actually the chords from an earlier theme
Britell – who also scored The Big Short and composed much of the music in 12 Years a Slave – reveals what he considers to be the most important musical movement of the past 50 years, and how a score enhances action in film
“The most interesting film music is when it’s saying something that isn’t on the picture – sometimes when music enters a scene, it just opens a scene in a certain way,” says Britell
 “Every composer has their internal emotional canvas – you’re taking emotions, and you’re translating them into these frequencies in the air that somehow affect us
”
“All over the countryside in China, in the most unexpected places, farmers are striving to build their own aircraft
 They don’t work in fancy hangars with all the equipment one could wish for, they simply play around in their backyards, recycling scrap metal and using household tools
 They are self-educated, self-employed and penniless
” In the foreword of the photobook Aeronautics in the Backyard, Dutch artist Gover Meit describes the people tinkering with machines in pictures taken by photographer Xiaoxiao Xu
 “They proudly call themselves ‘aeronauts’
’”

In 2015, Xu travelled across China, seeking out those aeronauts
 She had read about them in a Dutch magazine, and was inspired to find out more
 “I was deeply touched by the playfulness, inventiveness, flexibility and optimism of the aeronauts… and fascinated by the magical and fairytale qualities of the subject,” Xu tells BBC Culture
 “Fascinated by the rich imagination of these people and their romantic pursuit in contrast to their poor existence
 I wanted to know how they deal with the conflict between their dazzling imagination and their reality; what motivates them to continue; where does their persistence come from and where do their dreams lead them
”

After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Zhang aimed to build a helicopter that could fly among trees: his latest, with four aeromotors, is still in its test phase (Credit: Xiaoxiao Xu)
One of the aeronauts Xu photographed, Zhang Dousan, was born into a poor family in Chaozhou, Guangdong Province, and started working as a rock-breaker at the age of 13
 Seeing planes on TV inspired him to build his own: according to Xu, “all his friends burst into laughter when they heard his crazy dream, and his wife was always concerned that his test flights would fail”
 Despite not finishing primary school, Zhang studied the planes at a local airport and travelled to Beijing to buy parts at the aircraft factory
He retrieved an engine from the wreckage of a light aircraft destroyed in a typhoon, and in 1998, the first plane he built flew continuously for 500km
 It was a light two-seater aircraft with a 6m-long frame, and Zhang wrote “I’m from Chaozhou
 No striving, no win
” on the aerofoil
 He has built four more aircraft since, including one named Holy Eagle: its aeromotor is a converted car engine, and its control panel was taken from an abandoned plane
 His plan is to design a helicopter that can fly through forests and valleys to reach more people in rescue efforts
 Zhang told Xu: “I love creating
 I wouldn’t build an aircraft that already exists; I want to create my own designs and inventions
”

Xu’s photos show the makeshift materials used to construct the flying machines
 Workbenches are piled high with secondhand cogs; aluminium tubes lean against a wall, waiting to be hammered together for fuselage
 In one, there are three rusting wheels discarded on a concrete floor, all that’s left of an aeronaut’s decades of effort

From their perspective, it’s not about spending 30 years of their lives in order to fly 30m, it’s about spending 30 years of their lives turning the impossible into something tangible – Gover Meit
The 75-year-old farmer from Mianyang in Sichuan Province has built a dozen aircraft since he began working on them in 1984 – as of yet, none have flown
 Because he’s illiterate, the design process has been challenging – one model was based on a pigeon he bought in his village
 Yet he remains undaunted, telling Xu: “To me, making aircraft is a sort of entertainment, in the same way other people love playing Mahjong
 I just feel so happy when I make an aircraft
” His dream is that one day his aircraft will fly high enough to pass over a field of canola flowers
Aiming high
“The aeronauts don’t care about the risks or chance of irredeemable failure
 The mere notion that they might succeed, that they can enrich their lives in pursuit of their fantasies, is enough to drive them to build and fly aircraft until the day they die,” says Meit
 “They call this way of living ‘the aeronautics of life’; from their perspective, it’s not about spending 30 years of their lives in order to fly 30m, it’s about spending 30 years of their lives turning the impossible into something tangible
” Xu’s photos reveal both the heartbreak and the determination of the aeronauts, many of them lost in concentration as they fit parts into place

 But at 4
8km he had to abort the flight when temperatures dipped to -40°C

The images also reveal the dangers of flying handmade aircraft, based on knowledge cobbled from years of trial and error
 As Meit writes, “some dreamers have been hurt so badly that they’ll never walk again
 Some even laid down their lives for their hobby
 While many of the ‘lucky’ ones – who still live to tell the tale – have spent decades without ever even experiencing the sensation of defying gravity
”
Su Guibin – also from Chaozhou – had worked as a lift mechanic and in IT before becoming obsessed with aircraft
 Challenging himself to build his own helicopter, he pieced the parts together from unexpected sources: the joystick was taken from a video game console
 It was not without risk: in 2014, while flying an aircraft built by a fellow aeronaut, Su crashed into a telegraph pole, leaving him paralysed from the waist down
“I’ve been bedbound for three years,” he told Xu
 “My toes have recently regained some feeling
 However, the doctor said full recovery is still not guaranteed
 The only thing I can do is wait in bed
 A day in bed seems like a year to me
” Even so, according to Xu, “the first thing he plans to do after recovery is fly his aircraft”
 Her photos of him are not downbeat – he lies in bed, or sits in his wheelchair, with an expression that is hopeful rather than defeated
Wang Qiang (Credit: Xiaoxiao Xu)

Wang Qiang has also been in several accidents while flying his aircraft
 The barbershop owner from Cixi, Zhejiang Province attempted his first test flight in 2005, at an old airport in the suburbs of Mianyang
 After getting the aircraft ready for hours, he made his attempt at dusk
 “I taxied out, pulled the rod and the front wheel lifted off the ground,” he told Xu
 “Though the aircraft flew quite low – only 2m from the ground – the crowd were thrilled
 I was also taken aback by this moment; it was just so much fun, I was overjoyed
”
The best thing about aeronauts is that we’re bold
 We’re willing to test things out, even if it’s illegal
 Who else would dare to do it
 – He Dongbiao
Yet later flights weren’t so smooth
 “Once I flew to 300m and the engine suddenly shut down
  I attempted to glide safely back to land
 However, before I was able to steer it towards the runway, the aircraft crashed into the river
 I had to swim to the bank and then try to salvage the aircraft
” Another time, the engine failed just after lifting off and Wang crashed in the middle of a construction site
 “The aircraft ended up with its wheels pointing towards the sky and its back facing the earth: I was stuck there, upside down
 Fortunately, I had fastened the safety belt so I didn’t have any injuries
”
Despite that, he’s undeterred
 “Am I afraid after all these accidents
 Yes, but this fear is trivial
 More importantly, I feel increasingly steady and confident
 Every time I had an accident, I made some adjustments that improved the aircraft and made the test flights safer
”

” (Credit: Xiaoxiao Xu)
Xiaoxiao Xu’s approach is understated, piecing together images of each aeronaut with the same care that they take when welding together their recycled parts
 Alongside her portraits, the book features earlier photos taken by family members as well as blueprints, some computer-generated with intricate technical details, others just a scribble on a piece of crumpled paper
 We can see Xu Bin’s history as an aeronaut, with photos showing him when he first started building helicopters at the age of 20
 “Because of the small size of our backyard,” says the son of a machinist and a farmer from Jiangshan, Zhejiang Province, “I decided to make a helicopter – a handy option, given they don’t need a runway to take off
”
Highs and lows
There are also blurry snapshots of Xu Bin crashing in a field – and a photo of an aeronauts’ aviation museum that he opened in 2014
 The aeronauts have lofty ambitions – Wang told Xiaoxiao Xu: “China boasts such a vast territory and huge population… there are a lot of aviation amateurs
 If every one of us could fully develop our own innovations and designs, we could further promote our work as aeronauts together – it would be like there was blossom everywhere
”

” (Credit: Xiaoxiao Xu)
Xu Bin has started to make a living from his hobby
 “Companies in Guangzhou and Wenzhou have invited him to help with their aerial photography,” says the photographer
 “He sells autogyros and their parts, and also modifies autogyros into crop dusters
”
Gover Meit writes that “some are so successful that their hand-drawn designs get picked up by the commercial market, granting them jobs as aircraft engineers
 Others design mind-blowing new models that neither Nasa nor Hollywood could ever have thought of
 Not only are these farmers able to achieve the impossible, their unimpeded way of thinking is now helping science to discover more efficient and user-friendly ways to fly
” Xu’s photos capture that sense of adventure: on one level, the aeronauts are pioneering engineers; on another, they are still the children who stared wild-eyed at the birds in the sky above and dreamt of joining them
At the end of her travels, the photographer took a flight with Xu Bin
 “My heart pounding, I got into his two-seater autogyro… I cautiously put on my helmet and safety belt,” she says
 “Before long we were flying at 200m altitude
 For a moment I held my breath
 The aircraft has an open design, I felt the wind through my hair and saw the houses, mountains, fields, and lakes passing by below my feet; a feeling of dizziness took hold of me
Xu Bin (Credit: Xiaoxiao Xu)
Xu Bin taught himself how to fly by attaching an autogyro to a moving car with a rope: he’s now chief test pilot for local aeronauts
 (Credit: Xiaoxiao Xu)
“Fear set in, and I started to picture how exactly we were going to crash
 But then I spotted Xu Bin looking down below with the curiosity of a little boy
 He shone with intense happiness
 I began to appreciate just how much enjoyment he gets out of flying, from taking to the skies
 Despite the noise of the propeller, I almost reached a moment of Zen
 My fear faded, and I looked out… The lakes below were reflecting the light of the setting sun, everything seemed to glow and soften
 We made a few rounds in the sky, sometimes flying low, sometimes high up, over the fields and mountains
 Fifteen minutes later we had landed again, safely
”
Yuan Xiangqiu (Credit: Xiaoxiao Xu)
“It has antagonised… and inspired humankind,” says Meit
 “The sight of birds flying wherever they please, while not being able to lift off ourselves
” (Credit: Xiaoxiao Xu)
Xu captures this sense of boyhood curiosity most in her images of Yuan Xiangqiu
 Growing up in poverty in Tiantai, Zhejiang, he taught himself carpentry before being drawn to aircraft
 “I can’t give any specific reasons for why I want to build aircraft,” he told Xu
 “I remember when I was a kid there was a big camphor tree next to our house
 The tree was home to hundreds of birds
 I was fascinated by these birds – their flight was so beautiful, and I wanted to experience the feeling of being airborne too
” He has always believed he can build an airplane
 “Airplanes are similar to birds: wings, body, an engine, and then you can fly
”
“While we in the West are still waiting for some prodigal scientists to invent and develop a James Bond-style jetpack, these Chinese farmers might just be the genuine heroes who enable personal air trafficking in the coming years,” says Meit, acknowledging a universal human impulse
 “We all still dream of flying
 Not by having to buy an expensive ticket and sit in a metal box for hours among hundreds of fellow passengers, but by simply jumping up and taking off to whichever place we’d like to visit, not having to care about traffic jams or financial restraints
 We still long to fly freely, just as birds do
”
When a Saudi Arabian music video recently went viral, depicting niqab-clad female singers throwing shapes and chanting lines such as “may men disappear”, the colourful skit was hailed as a challenge to stereotypes
 Yet the spotlight barely shifted: the notion of the voiceless Arab female lingers in the mainstream, despite the fact that Saudi does not reflect the Arab world at large
 In fact, strong-voiced women have been a lynchpin of Arabic music in its far-ranging forms – from folk songs to commercial pop – across many generations and nations
“All of the Arabic women I grew up listening to or watching had a very strong character,” says Lebanese singer-songwriter Yasmine Hamdan
 She began her music career fronting Beirut’s first electro-punk outfit, Soapkills, in the late ‘90s, and is about to release her second solo album, Al Jamilat (The Beautiful Ones)
 “It’s normal; Arab women have always been very active at the forefront of culture – as film producers since the 1920s; as singers, dancers, choreographers, writers for much longer than that
”
The most iconic figure in Arabic music remains the Egyptian singer-songwriter and actress Umm Kulthum, known as ‘the Star of the East’
 Born into an imam’s family at the turn of the 20th Century, she was studying classical repertoire by her teens, and making her mark as an extraordinary vocal talent by the 1920s
 She also starred in several films, including 1937's Nashid Al Amal (The Chant Of Hope), in which she played a divorced single mother working to provide for her daughter; its soundtrack included The University Song, with typical themes of determination, solidarity and national fervour
 She presented womanhood at the forefront of national identity, alongside men, singing about politics as well as romantic epics
(Credit: Alamy)

Umm Kulthum proved an astute businesswoman as well as an accomplished performer; her powerful repertoire and savvy collaborations covered patriotic sentiments as well as yearning serenades, and Hamdan argues that “the unity of the Arab world was embodied in Umm Kulthum’s voice”
 By the time of her death in 1975, she had earned international acclaim
 As musicologist Virginia Danielson writes in Harvard Magazine, “Imagine a singer with the virtuosity of Joan Sutherland or Ella Fitzgerald, the public persona of Eleanor Roosevelt and the audience of Elvis, and you have Umm Kulthum”
The spirit of the original female singers – mellifluous yet headstrong, poetic and political – is embodied in a new generation
Many of the pioneering stars of Arabic music were connected with the emerging ‘golden age’ of Egyptian cinema, which brought their talent and glamour to mass audiences
 Top-billed names included Leila Mourad, from a Jewish Cairene family, and Asmahan, who came from a background of Syrian Druze nobility, and whose mesmerising musical range was cut short with her death in 1944, aged just 31
 The orchestral songs of this era are still Arab pop culture staples, regularly covered alongside current commercial hits on reality shows like Arab Idol; however, the spirit of the original female singers – mellifluous yet headstrong, poetic and political, open to varied styles – is arguably best embodied in a new generation of independent artists
(Credit: Alamy)

Hamdan describes hearing Asmahan’s track Ya Habibi Ta’ala (My Beloved, Come) in a Beirut club at 4am as a musical “epiphany”; she recalls: “It felt extremely elegant, eloquent and emotional; sophisticated and edgy for its time
” On the electronic productions of her debut solo album, 2013’s Ya Nass (Hey People), Hamdan paid homage to the likes of Asmahan and Mourad, as well as legendary Egyptian singer/composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab, through covers and soulful original material
Finding a voice
On her new album, Hamdan mostly focuses on her own songs, written from the perspective of female characters
 “They have a lot of contradictions; I like to show my taste for imperfection,” she laughs
 “These characters are both dominant and fragile, which is beautiful to me
” Choosing to sing in Arabic when her peers were gravitating to Western pop was, in its own way, a form of rebellion
 She told the Guardian: “I felt that the Arabic language was a raw material that could be shaped, freely
 This was something that was thrilling to me
”
Conflicting judgements of ‘respectability’ across the Arab world, about anything from dress codes to lyrics and mixed audiences, are another source of rebellion
 “Well, there are lots of codes in Arabic music, and it’s not easy to break them,” replies Hamdan, who is now based in Paris with her husband (the Palestinian film director, Elia Suleiman), and continues to tour internationally
 “But the conservatism is not only in religion; it can be social or intellectual, and there is a kind of taboo in touching ‘sacred’ older songs
”

The Tunisian-born New York-based protest musician Emel Mathlouthi, whose second album Ensen (Human) has just been released, echoes this sentiment: “We have a lot of female Arab pop stars, so that’s not a problem, but I definitely think that it’s harder when you have your own project,” she says
 “In the Arab world, there are high expectations of good singers, which I really like, but the mainstream also has a very traditional approach, and it’s hard to get away from the image of the ‘static diva’

When I sing in my first language, whether in dialect or classical Arabic, the singing has another dimension – Emel Mathlouthi
The so-called “voice of the Tunisian Revolution” is a dynamic and politically conscious performer; her work has regularly tackled inequality and her track Kelmti Horra (My Word Is Free) was embraced as an anthem of the Arab Spring, leading to her performance at the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize Concert
 Mathlouthi cites influences including “the strong vocals and deep songs” of Lebanese superstar Fairuz (who, like her compatriot Sabah, has headlined worldwide venues including New York’s Carnegie Hall, London’s Royal Albert Hall, and the Paris Olympia), and the Egyptian protest singer and composer Sheikh Imam
 She’s also a fan of US singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell – on this year’s International Women’s Day, Mathlouthi is taking part in a concert celebrating Mitchell’s album Hejira at London’s Southbank Centre
Mathlouthi says she wanted her album Ensen “to reflect on the contrasts of Arab Muslim society; this album was a quest about how to connect with heritage, and how to distribute that with a personal touch
” She believes the choice of language itself can be a form of speaking out
 “What I find hard right now is that when a woman sings in Arabic, unless it’s in an exotic context or party music, it blocks her from participating in the mainstream
 Perhaps this is true of most non-English tongues, but when I sing in my first language, whether in dialect or fusha [classical Arabic], the singing has another dimension
 As Arabs, it’s important that we associate our voices with art and positive expressions
”
Beyond the mainstream
By stepping out of the mainstream, many artists can gain more autonomy – and tap into the legacy of strong female Arab artists at the same time
 Around the Middle East, diverse underground and DIY music scenes offer a counterpoint to glossy commercial Arab pop
 Maryam Saleh, a singer-songwriter from Cairo, argues that both female and male players have to strive equally hard in this independent realm, where there is relatively little infrastructure for venues and labels: in fact, compared to male counterparts, she says, “you somehow harbour a sense of empowerment as an independent female artist here”

Of course, strong female voices aren’t always in synch; for Saleh, Umm Kulthum represents a music and business talent who aligned with authority: “Her voice, interpretation, choices and alliances summed up to turn her into an icon and institution
 In the case of female alternative artists today, they are truly independent, as well as being the composers and producers of their own work; [Palestinian singer and musician] Kamilya Jubran is a great example
”
Saleh’s music, such as the track Toul El-Tarie (On All The Roads), is beautifully poetic and gritty, and her songs combine her own lyrics with past and present Arabic poetry, including her Egyptian contemporary Mido Zoheir
 “I’m drawn to texts that unassumingly express sentiments we feel in everyday life… sort of like riddles, satirical, yet they strike very personal chords,” she says
Sarah El-Miniawy, who founded the ground-breaking international music management and PR agency Simsara, argues that “alternative Arabic music, or any non-English speaking music for that matter, is hardly featured in mainstream media; when it is, the framing is within the politics of the region, and that’s the same for both genders
“There is no denying that the environment is tougher on Arab independent artists, and so naturally you become more resourceful with the little you have
 If we go as far as saying that being oppressed inspires you and makes you more determined, then it verges on romanticising a dire reality
 Independent musicians in the Arab world pursue their vocation just like any other musician elsewhere, and they adapt to the lifestyle it brings to them
”
Both El-Miniawy and Saleh point out that, in the digital age, these varied forms in music and arts develop more swiftly than ever
 And it is in this limitless space that more points of connection are made across the Arab world, between genres and generations, with strong female voices shifting shape, confronting reality and summoning fantasy, and continuing to resonate
A make-up designer’s tricks of the tradeThe tributaries of the Rio Negro are teeming with music
 On the outskirts of Manaus, capital of the Amazonas province, there is a symphony of unparalleled variety – the call of the yellow-rumped cacique bird, the cadences of cicadas, the cacophony of capuchin monkeys
 When the water is calm, you can hear the clicking of pink dolphins that glide in the black silted stream
The music of Manaus is not restricted to its wildlife
 The ‘Paris of the Tropics’, as it became known in the late 19th Century, is home to a remarkable cultural monument: the Teatro Amazonas (Amazon Theatre), a majestic opera house that dominates the city’s main square
 Testament to the wealth of Manaus at the height of its rubber boom, the theatre is a curious attempt to replicate European cultural taste in the heart of the tropical rainforest
(Credit: Alamy)

The opera house was inaugurated on 31 December, 1896, after 15 years of painstaking construction and negotiation
 With the exception of locally-sourced wood, all the materials were imported from Europe, and no expense was spared
 One hundred and ninety-eight crystal chandeliers came from Italy, including 32 made from Venetian Murano glass, while Scottish cast iron holds up the 22 vibrating hollow columns that contribute to the excellent acoustics
The most elegant feature of the 700-seat theatre is the curvature of the auditorium, arrayed in the shape of a lyre
 The Italian architect, Celestial Sacardim, modelled the interior on the Palais Garnier in Paris, and the ceiling, painted by a fellow Italian, offers the impression of looking up reverentially at the Eiffel Tower
The theatre’s iconic dome is both innovative and controversial – even to this day
Not all of the artistry is European
 The 75-metre-high stage is adorned with a curtain illustrated by Brazilian painter Crispim do Amaral, which depicts the local water goddess Iara amid the nearby ‘meeting of the waters’, between the black Rio Negro and the milky Rio Solimões
The most imaginative innovation is the iconic dome, created from 36,000 tiles imported from Alsace, upon which a Brazilian flag is emblazoned
 It was during the construction of the theatre, in 1889, that Brazil became a republic, ending the imperial rule of Dom Pedro II
 The new republican spirit, a century after France’s own revolution, is evident in the motto at the centre of the flag, Order and Progress, which derives from the positivist philosophy of a Parisian, Auguste Comte

The dome was a controversial construction, and it continues to divide critics, according to tour guide, Samir Torres
 Traditionalists deemed it a bizarre addition – neither formal nor symmetrical, nor of utility (it does not form part of the interior, and the roof had to be reinforced to support its weight)
 While some deride the dome as a ‘big colourful hat’, I think it makes a fitting crown for a building that fuses architectural styles (Renaissance, Baroque, neo-classical)
‘To be seen was more important than to see’
The new civic spirit of the republic did not alter the social mores of the opera’s patrons
 Samir points out that the worst seats in the house, jutting out at the tip of the lyre, were also the most publicly prominent, and raised the most money at auction
 To be seen was more important than to see
Samir is amused by the image of socialites donning layers of formal evening wear in the tropical heat, and he describes the spectacle as “a fashion competition
 People would melt here to show off
”
 To accommodate the modish aspirations of its patrons, the theatre experimented with one of the earliest air-conditioning systems, aiming to provide relief as temperatures soared to 40C (104F) and humidity rose to 90%
Under the energetic governorship of Eduardo Ribeiro, whose contribution is commemorated throughout the theatre, Manaus was transformed from a provincial town to a major seat of commerce and culture
 By the turn of the century, Manaus was the first Brazilian city to have trams and the second with electric lighting
 Dingy streets were transformed into Parisian-style boulevards, bordering Italian piazzas with fountains, while rubber barons commissioned opulent mansions in which they entertained their peers with concerts and parties
In its first two decades, the opera house attracted artists from around Europe
Less grandiose were the living conditions of the workers who constructed the theatre, and in particular those who laboured to tap rubber, many of whom were remunerated only with food and lodging, and found themselves trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty
 Nonetheless, Manaus was not immune to social change: the city became the first to elect a mixed-race governor, whose father was born a slave, and who lived in a residence near the theatre
In its first two decades, the opera house attracted prominent artists from around Europe, but it also helped nurture Brazilian talent
 In the sumptuous ballroom, replete with gold leaf and a floor comprised of 12,000 wood panels, there is a bust of Carlos Gomes, the first New World composer to be celebrated in Europe
 The centrepiece of the room is a painting of Gomes’ most renowned opera, Il Guarany (“the Brazilian Romeo and Juliet”, according to Samir)
A golden age
Manaus’ belle epoque ended almost as abruptly as Europe’s
 In fact, as the theatre was being built, the seeds of the city’s demise were being sown
 An Englishman, Henry Wickham, began to smuggle thousands of rubber pods to British colonies in Malaysia and Sri Lanka
 Within 20 years, these plantations were producing rubber more cheaply and efficiently, and the Amazonian rubber market soon collapsed
 The theatre was forced to close in 1924, and although Manaus experienced a brief revival when Japan occupied British plantations during World War Two, the ‘golden age’ lasted less than three decades

The city continued to maintain its theatre, which became a national historic landmark in 1966, and it underwent various renovations: the exterior was changed from pink to blue in 1929, and then to grey between 1972-74, to match the military junta’s colour scheme for all public buildings
 (Evidence of this drab exterior comes in the form of a 30,000-piece Lego model, a gift from Denmark in 1973)
 The facade reverted to its original pink after a public ballot in 1990
For over 70 years, the Teatro Amazonas did not host a performance - except from an intriguing cameo appearance in the opening scene of Werner Herzog’s 1982 film, Fitzcarraldo
 The protagonist of the movie is an opera-obsessed rubber baron who paddles for thousands of kilometres down the Amazon from Iquitos in Peru to Manaus, to watch a performance by the celebrated tenor Enrico Caruso
There is a degree of historical accuracy to this fiction: the first performance at the theatre, on 7 January, 1897, featured Caruso in Ponchielli’s opera La Gioconda
 It was said that the entire opera house was built just to lure him to Manaus, so that the rubber barons could hear the world’s most popular tenor
 More recently, a Bollywood movie was filmed in the theatre, with actors from Mumbai dressed in fin de siècle European attire
The Amazonas Philharmonic has an international reputation – 39 of its 54 members are from Russia, Belarus and Bulgaria
The theatre reopened briefly in 1990, but was forced to close after a fortnight, embroiled in a scandal about accessibility
 (Manaus residents protested on the steps: “We paid for this opening, but we are left outside
”)
 Only in 1997 did the theatre begin to host regular concerts, with the establishment of the Amazonas Philharmonic

When I visited in March, the theatre was gearing up to host the 21st annual Amazonas Opera Festival, which runs from April to May
 A small exhibition showcases costumes from previous productions, including finery from a performance of Bizet’s Carmen in 2014
 The White Stripes gave a concert here in 2004, and the philharmonic has benefitted from an international reputation: of the 54-member orchestra, 39 are from Russia, Belarus and Bulgaria
The theatre has a busy schedule: on consecutive nights, I watched the Amazonas Jazz Band and the Guitar Orchestra, along with a day rehearsal of the Experimental Orchestra
 Each performance was open to all and free to attend, and attended by a capacity crowd that crammed into the once exclusive boxes
On the ceiling of the ballroom, there is a painting titled The Glorification of the Arts in the Amazon, in which gods and goddesses bestow their gifts from above
 For some of its early progenitors, the theatre expressed an idea of culture removed from nature
 They sought to tame a wild habitat with a vision of civilisation cultivated in Paris, and nurtured by men eager for European grandeur
 The spirit of the Amazonas offers an altogether more organic interpretation; so that, in musical terminology, it acts not in dissonance, but in harmony
For two days each year, the air in India and Nepal is a living canvas, drenched in the rich reds of powdered pomegranate and pulverised hibiscus, the vibrant yellows of crushed chrysanthemums and macerated marigold, and the giddy greens of ground gulmohar leaves
 Revellers attending the annual Holi, or ‘Festival of Colours’, blur the boundaries between artist and art, creator and created, as they fling fistfuls of pigment and buckets of tinted water at each other – friend and stranger alike
 Saturated and singing, festival goers move amid the hubbub of riotous hues like psychedelic ghosts – their bodies dissolving into the endlessly shifting veils of vapourising colour that engulf them
Held each year to celebrate the end of winter and the return of luminous intensity to the budding landscape, Holi has its roots in ancient Hindi culture and is timed with the approach of the spring equinox
 What distinguishes it from other fertility celebrations, however, is its emphasis on the resurrection of colour in the flowering world – colour, that is to say, as a quality prised away from the contours of any particular shape or blossoming crop
 Such unbridled jubilation, with all its chaos of chromatism, seems a grand affirmation of the Romantic essayist Leigh Hunt’s sprightly assertion that “colours are the smiles of nature” – a spontaneous overflow of feeling that we fail to reciprocate at our own diminishment
The instinct to separate a form’s radiant complexion from the material substance of the thing itself has significant parallels in art history and emerged as a driving force behind some of the most important movements of modern art
 A century ago, a clutch of American artists calling themselves ‘Synchromists’ attempted to isolate the rhythms of abstracted colour in a manner analogous to the arrangement of notes by musicians
 Attaching to their works titles such as Cosmic Synchromy (a seminal painting from 1913-14 by one of the group’s founders, Morgan Russell), the movement tried to place its finger on the pulse of pure pigmentation – the eye-music of the spheres
Although crucial to the eventual arrival of a fully-fledged American Abstract Expressionism in the ensuing decades, Synchromism failed to achieve the kind of break-out success enjoyed by a contemporary Russian painter and aesthetic theorist who likewise became obsessed with the difference between the physical forms of nature and the urgency of their colours
 Wassily Kandinsky’s pioneering and influential 1912 text, Du Spirituel dans l’art (or Concerning the Spiritual in Art), gave verbal expression to sentiments that invigorate every ecstatic lob of crushed jacaranda in the air during Holi
 “Colour”, Kandinsky wrote, “is a power which directly influences the soul
 Colour is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings
”

Wassily Kandinsky’s Composition VII (1913) appears “to capture the cosmic instant during creation before colour and substance have finally cohered” (Credit: Wikimedia)
Kandinsky’s famous canvas Composition VII, created the year after he published his treatise on the spiritual in art, is a kind of visual accompaniment to the libretto of his manifesto’s ideas and the painting for which he made more preliminary plans than any other in his career
 A vortex of violently churning tinges and tones, the work would appear to capture the cosmic instant during creation before colour and substance have finally cohered under the hammer of the almighty eye
 Traces of figurative details that can connect the work to religious subjects – the Resurrection and Paradise – are swallowed in a deluge of reverence for colour
 Like the photo from this week’s Holi, Kandinsky’s Composition VII is an exuberant acknowledgement of nature’s joyous greeting, and a soulful smile right back
It is one of life’s smouldering ironies that smoking tobacco damages the body while holding a pipe sharpens the mind
 “The pipe,” the British novelist William Makepeace Thackeray once wrote, “draws wisdom from the lips of the philosopher and shuts up the mouths of the foolish; it generates a style of conversation contemplative, thoughtful, benevolent, and unaffected
” Nor was Thackeray alone in thinking so
 Albert Einstein insisted pipes were instrumental in teasing out “calm and objective judgement in all human affairs”, while Arthur Conan Doyle’s literary invention, Sherlock Holmes, famously measured out the complexity of crime in pinches and puffs: “it is quite a three-pipe problem”
Curved quizzically into question marks, pipes are the very shape of thought
 They are as temperamentally transformative as they are physically compromising
 If a writer or artist wants to interject an air of meditation into a scene, the interposition of a pipe is the shortest of shorthands for doing so
 The Dutch Old Masters made great use of the pipe smoker, and later artists such as Paul Cézanne and James McNeill Whistler would recast him as an allegory of life’s slow exhalation into air
 (Vincent van Gogh auditioned himself several times in the role of the pipe-wielding contemplative
)

Smokers in an Inn by Mattheus van Helmont is an example of how painters have used the pipe throughout art history (Credit: Wikimedia)
When the Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte wanted us to reflect on the inherent disconnection between representations of reality and reality itself, he did not scrawl across his provocative canvas The Treachery of Images (1928-29) “this is not a glass”, “
 or a tree”, “
 or a chair”, but rather “Ceci n'est pas une pipe”: “this is not a pipe”
As a prop, the pipe has slowly sculpted itself since its earliest appearances in Dutch Golden Age painting of the 17th Century into something intensely philosophical – a cue to the eyes that the scene they behold is an allegory to muse upon: a meditation on life, not life itself
 Until now
 An extraordinary photo, taken by the AFP’s Joseph Eid in the battle-ravaged Syrian city of Aleppo, has forced us to rethink the cultural cliché of the pensive pipe as mere metaphor
 Shot in the ruined, bomb-rattled home of Mohammed Mohiedin Anis (also known as Abu Omar), a 70-year old collector of vintage cars, the image is a mute dirge to the savage devastations of war
(Credit: Joseph Eid/AFP)

Sitting on the edge of his bed with his legs crossed as he listens to music on a record player, Abu Omar seems at first glance a caricature of art historical introspection – a composite of countless portraits of a nostalgic subject cradling the smooth stummel of his parabolic pipe
 But the scene of utter destruction in which Abu Omar’s romantic frame incongruously sits (from the shattered shutters shielding paneless windows to the shrapnel strewn carpet and bedspread) is all too literal and unstaged – an admonishment for blurring the boundaries between life and art
 What we see is not an imagined projection of interior introspection or a fanciful tableau woven from waftings of symbolic smoke
 No, this is not a pipe
 It’s something far more powerful than that
António da Madelena, a Portuguese Capuchin friar, was one of the first Western visitors to Angkor Wat, the monumental and moated 12th Century Hindu-Buddhist temple in what, today, is northern Cambodia
 It “is of such extraordinary construction”, he told the historian Diogo do Couto in 1589, “that it is not possible to describe it with a pen, particularly since it is like no other building in the world
 It has towers and decoration and all the refinements which the human genius can conceive of
”
Europeans were baffled for centuries by what they found at Angkor
By the time of Madelena’s visit, the once mighty Khmer Empire that had built Angkor and its temple dedicated to Vishnu – mistaken by visitors even today for a walled and towered city – had fallen
 Three centuries later, Europeans were baffled by what they found at Angkor
 Henri Mouhout, a young French naturalist and explorer who died here in 1861 and whose writings, published posthumously, encouraged successive waves of archaeologists to Cambodia in pursuit of a lost ancient civilisation, could make neither head nor tail of what he saw
(Credit: Alamy)
Angkor Wat is the largest religious complex in the world, covering a space of 500 acres (2 sq km) – it was initially built as a Hindu temple to honour Vishnu (Credit: Alamy)
“One of these temples – a rival to that of Solomon and erected by some ancient Michelangelo might take an honourable place beside our most beautiful buildings,” he wrote
 “It is grander than anything left to us by Greece or Rome, and presents a sad contrast to the state of barbarism in which the nation is now plunged
”
It seemed inconceivable to Mouhout that the “barbaric” Khmers could have built Angkor Wat, let alone the other temples and palaces spread around it across some 500 acres (2 sq km)
 But, the Khmers did build Angkor Wat at the zenith of their once dynamic empire that, founded in 802, fell in 1431 when the rival Ayutthaya (Thai) kingdom to the north sacked Angkor
 The seat of the remnant Khmer kingdom moved to Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital today
Stranded in the jungle
Although Angkor Wat and its attendant cities, temples, reservoirs, terraces, pools and palaces have been a magnetic 21st Century tourist attraction – when I came here in the mid-1990s I would have been one of around 7,500 annual visitors; last year there were 2
5 million, very many from China
Angkor Wat was the epicentre of a sprawling city at least as big as Berlin
We now know, thanks to the forensic aerial mapping conducted since 2007 by Damian Evans and Jean-Baptiste Chevance, using ground-sensing radar developed by Nasa in the 1960s, that Angkor Wat was the epicentre of a sprawling city at least as big as Berlin
 At its zenith during the reign of Jayavarman VII (1181-1218), it was the mighty heart of the largest empire of its time
(Credit: Alamy)

In 2012, Evans, a faculty member of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Sydney and founding member and deputy director of the Greater Angkor Project, and Chevance, an archaeologist with the École française d’Extrême-Orient, founded in 1900, discovered the ‘lost city’ of Mahendraparvata on the plateau of Phnom Kulen
 Twenty-five miles north of Angkor, this planned city with its grid of boulevards had been hidden by vegetation for centuries
 Founded by the warrior-priest monarch Jayavarman II in 802, it was the ‘template’ of Angkor and its great temple
 Since 2012, Mahendraparvata has proved to be even bigger than Evans and Chevance had first thought
(Credit: Wikipedia)
This drawing of the temple’s façade was made by Henri Mouhout, a French explorer who visited the site in the mid 19th Century and could not believe his eyes (Credit: Wikipedia)
The discovery of this city was only possible thanks to Lidar, a form of aerial laser scanning that, mounted in helicopters, sees through the ground below, identifying streets and buildings where all the human eye can see is fields and forests
 Expensive until recently, the technology is now available to archaeologists and, operated in the near future by drones rather than helicopters, it may well enable them to make further astounding discoveries, especially of fabled ‘lost cities’
(Credit: Alamy)
Jayavarman VII was the ruler of the Khmer Empire from 1181 to 1218 and is widely regarded as its most powerful leader – he oversaw the completion of the temple (Credit: Alamy)
It may have been possible to make such discoveries some years earlier in Cambodia, but until 1998 Phnom Kulem was the last refuge of Pol Pot and his murderous Khmer Rouge, the fanatical Communist organisation that ruled the country from 1975 to 1979, executing and starving to death some two million people, or a fifth of the population
 The area remains alive with landmines
If the discovery of the scale and ambition of Mahendraparvata was a remarkable event, the uncovering of the sheer scale of Angkor has been mind-bending
 From its moated temple with its lotus-bud towers, its courtyards and galleries, friezes of warriors, kings, demons, battles and three thousand heavenly nymphs, all shaped in thirty-seven years by 300,000 workers and 6,000 elephants, or so inscriptions say, from millions of sandstone slabs floated down from Phnom Kulen, Angkor stretched for miles around
Urban planning
This, perhaps, was the first low-density city – a phenomenon normally associated with the railway age, the car and the spread of suburbia – a vast-reaching conurbation, its parts linked by an ambitious network of roads and canals, reservoirs and dams carved from the forest
Angkor, like many cities today, simply overextended itself
What’s more, Khmer cities were connected to one another, so the “built-up” area of Angkor seems to have been bigger than anyone today, much less barefoot 16th Century Portuguese friars, has been able to figure
 An enormous and intricate irrigation system mapped by Evans and Chevance provided Angkor with food – rice for the main part – and yet the ever-increasing scale of this engineered and well populated landscape was, it seems, its undoing
(Credit: Alamy)
The Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, were responsible for the deaths of almost a quarter of Cambodia’s population – they held out near Angkor Wat until 1999 (Credit: Alamy)
Put simply, Angkor overreached itself – like many modern cities worldwide today
 It was not simply military invasion from what is now Thailand that hastened the fall of the Khmer Empire, but the imperious ambition of rulers and cities
 What proved to be overpopulation caused unsustainable deforestation, the degradation of topsoil and the overworking of the irrigation system that would have required a huge workforce to keep it in a permanent state of good repair
For all the raised roadways with rest houses sited every 15km (9 miles) and hospitals built by Jayavarman VII, who used ambitious architecture and grand plans to keep the peace as well as to express the confidence and culture of the Khmer Empire, the jungle would reclaim these mighty works
(Credit: Alamy)
Because of the Khmer Rouge presence nearby through the '90s only a few thousand people would visit Angkor Wat a year at that time – millions now visit annually (Credit: Alamy)
Angkor today, along with such romantic temples as Jayavarman VII’s Ta Prohm, where enormous cotton silk trees and their fairy-tale roots appear to hold the architecture in wild embrace, and known to cinema goers through the film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), is threatened anew not by invading armies but by mass tourism
 Already, brash new ‘luxury’ air-conditioned tour-group hotels, featuring swimming pools, hot tubs and spas, dominate the once small French Colonial town of Siem Reap, no longer a walk, but now an air-conditioned coach ride from Angkor Wat
Such is the use of water by the millions of tourists heading this way each year that the water table of the area under sandy soil is threatened
 Its decline is damaging the very stones of the 12th-Century temple; meanwhile, visitors take photographs of themselves and shout into theirΩΩ mobile phones
As laser-mapping technology becomes more readily available, perhaps archaeologists might help to divert some of the millions heading to Angkor Wat to elsewhere in Cambodia and Southeast Asia
 Even so, what Angkor has that will keep drawing the crowds is the world’s biggest temple – and one that remains enigmatically magnificent
When Buffy Summers first arrives in Sunnydale, the last thing she wants to do is slay vampires
 She wants to do science projects, date boys, make friends, and even make enemies – as long as those enemies are more along the lines of cheerleading rivals, rather than vampire masters set on destroying the world via Sunnydale’s Hellmouth
She does everything she can to resist her destiny as the Slayer, but by the end of the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, there is no doubt: she must rise to the talents she’s been given
 And upon slaying the Master, she reluctantly accepts this destiny herself
(Credit: 20th Century Fox Television)

Buffy showed us what television could do, and was about to do
But Buffy had another destiny as well – as the harbinger of the current ‘Golden Age of Television’
 When the show premiered in 1997, it seemed at worst a joke, at best a novelty destined for a short life
 Instead it contained the seeds of a startling number of trends to come for the medium
 Of course, Buffy was a watershed moment for the portrayal of young women on television, giving us a witty, smart heroine uniquely equipped to do no less than save the world
 And it brought vampires back well before the age of Twilight
 But it also innovated in more artful ways: combining fantasy and grounded realism in a way that prefigured everything from Alias and Lost to Jane the Virgin and the many superhero shows we have today; displaying a postmodern self-consciousness that’s ubiquitous in current programming; and experimenting with the form of television itself via a silent episode and a musical episode
 In short, Buffy showed us what television could do, and was about to do
Buffy’s maiden run in pop culture came in a 1992 film starring Kristy Swanson and written by Joss Whedon
 The writer had envisioned a movie that would subvert horror clichés: he told Time magazine that he’d thought, "I would love to see a movie in which a blonde wanders into a dark alley, takes care of herself and deploys her powers
" But director Fran Ruben Kuzui turned Whedon’s script into “a broad comedy,” as Whedon later said, instead of adhering to his original vision of a “scary film about an empowered woman”
 The result was a poorly reviewed flop
 A few years later, Whedon brought his original vision to television, which turned out to suit it better, allowing an unfolding mythology and a coming-of-age story that could develop over a number of years
Girl power
The two-hour series premiere first aired in the United States on The WB network on 10 March 1997
 In it Buffy, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, tried to start her life fresh at a new school only to find herself pulled back into the slayer duties she thought she’d left behind when she moved
 Critics loved its genre-mashing from the start; Time magazine called it “the most talked-about show to have debuted in the past months”
 The magazine added, “Buffy churns a wry, ongoing parable of the modern woman's greatest conflict: the challenge to balance personal and professional life
” Throughout the first season, the show followed a fairly linear progression, with each episode featuring a monster-of-the-week for Buffy to vanquish with the help of her friends Xander and Willow and ‘Watcher’-turned-school librarian Giles, played by English actor Anthony Head
(Credit: Alamy)
Buffy’s romance with vampire-turned-ally Angel (David Boreanaz, right) hooked audiences long before the age of Twilight (Credit: Alamy)
The empowered heroine and monster-laden plots lent Buffy a cross-gender appeal and a subversive edge
It wasn’t until the first season finale that Buffy grew more complex as a character, as did Buffy the TV show
 In its subsequent six seasons, it developed a life-shattering romance between Buffy and her broody vampire ally Angel (David Boreanaz), introduced bad-guy-turned-good Spike, faced the complications of sex and death, and bestowed upon Willow her own powers as well as a then-groundbreaking romance with another girl
 The empowered heroine and the monster-laden plots lent it a cross-gender appeal and a subversive edge: "If I can make teenage boys comfortable with a girl who takes charge of a situation without their knowing that's what's happening, it's better than sitting down and selling them on feminism," Whedon told Time
Buffy’s complexity soon won critical acclaim and a rabid cult following
 In fact, it was supposed to end with Buffy’s death in the fifth season finale, The Gift, but it was so popular that Whedon agreed to revive her for two more (less-focused) years on a new network, UPN
 When the show ended for good in 2003, critics eulogised it despite acknowledgements that it had lived past its prime
 “Blending fantasy with social realism, Whedon made the least-condescending show about young adults to run on prime time in recent memory,” Slate’s Hillary Frey wrote
(Credit: Netflix)

After Buffy’s finale, its mystique only grew
 Its metaphorical depiction of the horrors of high school held up for new generations of DVD viewers and then streamers
 It provided a deeper portrait of vampires – and the teen girls who love and/or slay them – than the Twilight craze of the late 2000s and beyond
 The ‘kick-ass heroine’ became something of a trope – a welcome one – thanks to Buffy
 But most of all, the show’s realistic relationships and elaborate mythology make for perfect viewing in the age of binge-watching
But it isn’t just new young fans who are enamored
 A few years ago, Slate determined that Buffy had become academia’s most-studied pop cultural artifact
 And its influence lives on in shows being made today: "I think Buffy has been a huge factor in what TV looks like now – the mixture of tones in shows like Orange is the New Black feels Buffy-like to me, the recognition that humour creeps into our darkest moments,” Buffy writer Jane Espenson told SyFy Wire
 Writer Drew Z Greenberg added: “Buffy established that it was okay to have a show which was both fun and intelligent – that you could be engrossing, mainstream, pop entertainment while still having something to say, still having a specific point of view about the world… And as legacies go, I think that’s a pretty good one

Add another title to poor Buffy’s list of grand fated destinies: Enduring Cultural Muse
Had it been built, its spiral steel frame would have stood taller than the Eiffel Tower, at that time the world’s tallest manmade structure, by some 91m (299 ft)
 And its record as the world’s tallest building would have gone unsurpassed for over half a century, until the construction of the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers, which opened for business in 1973
The Monument to the Third International, otherwise known as Tatlin’s Tower, was designed in 1919 by Russian artist and architect Vladimir Tatlin, following the October Revolution of 1917
 It was a revolutionary design

The steel frame would contain three glass units: a cube, a cylinder and a cone
 These would rotate once a year, once a month and once a day respectively, and house a conference hall, a legislative chamber and an information and propaganda centre for the Third Communist International (also known as the Comintern – the organisation that advocated world communism)
 It would stand at just over 396 m (1,306 ft)
 But for reasons of cost (Russia was bankrupt and in the middle of a civil war) and practicality (was its realisation even structurally possible, and where, after all, would they get all that steel
) this staggeringly audacious symbol of modernity was never built
  We encounter it today through photographs of the original model, long destroyed, and through reconstructions
The artist’s mission was to create work for the benefit of the people and for making a new society
Tatlin was a radical avant-garde artist before the Bolsheviks seized power: rather more modest in scale were his pre-Revolution wood and metal constructions, which he called ‘counter-reliefs’, and which overturned traditional notions of sculpture
 But Tatlin would soon become the chief proponent of a revolutionary art whose purpose was to support the utopian ideal of the Soviet state
 A new kind of art, which forcefully rejected the past, for a new world that would look only to the future
 It came to be known as Constructivism, and as an avant-garde force it co-existed alongside the Suprematism of Kazimir Malevich (whose astonishing Black Square of 1915 presented an end-point in painting) and his protégé El Lissitzky
Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge

The brilliant geometric abstraction of Suprematism transformed easel painting into the most radical expression of pure form and colour, but it was Lissitzky who put it most dynamically at the service of the state
 His 1919 lithograph Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge, can hardly be more politically charged
 The red wedge penetrates the white circle, which symbolises the Red Army penetrating the defences of the anti-communist and imperialist forces of the White Army
 This early work cleverly plays with negative and positive space and anticipates a group of architectonic paintings, drawings and sketches that Lissitzky called ‘Prouns’ (an acronym for ‘project for the affirmation of the new’ in Russian) which lifted the flatness of Suprematism into the three-dimensional visual plane
 It was, incidentally, this work that inspired the name of Red Wedge, a 1980s British group of Labour Party-supporting musician-activists, headed by Billy Bragg
Children of the revolution
When we think of the art and design of the first decade of the Soviet Union, we usually think only of these groundbreaking figures, designers and artists who also included Lyubov Popova, a painter who soon called for the abandonment of ‘bourgeois’ easel painting, declaring that the artist’s mission was to create work for the benefit of the people and for making a new society
 And we think too of perhaps the greatest photographer, graphic designer and typographer of the era, Alexander Rodchenko
 Rodchenko’s 1924 advertising image for a Soviet publisher, in which the model Lilya Brik gives the siren call ‘Books
’, with one hand cupped to her mouth and with the word written in bold Cyrillic type, is probably the single best known image in Soviet art history

Yet many styles and movements coexisted in those first few post-Revolutionary years
 But you wouldn’t necessarily know this since curators in the west have long been interested only in the radical aesthetics of the Russian avant-garde, while happily underplaying the politics that underpinned it – shying away from its narratives, in other words – in order to highlight the work’s purely formal aspects
 This is, to be fair, also the fate of religious or spiritual works of art (esoteric spiritual beliefs, for instance, run through the story of modernism)
 We appear content to render these works all painterly surface and form and to largely ignore the things that no longer speak directly to us
In this centenary year of the October Revolution, an exhibition at London’s Royal Academy, Revolution: Russian Art 1917-1932, seeks to act as a corrective
 In this vast, sprawling and sobering exhibition we’re confronted by artists, many little-known outside Russia, who worked in a range of styles to promote the newly fledged Soviet state
 Here the traditional overwhelms the new, the figurative trounces the abstract
 And very early on we see a nascent Socialist Realism, an idealised figurative style in which the worker achieves heroic status as he or she helps build a socialist utopia, alongside 19th-Century-style realist portraits of Lenin and Stalin
 Lenin, who died in 1924, was avowedly conservative in artistic matters, and had begun to feel sure that avant-gardism would alienate the proletariat
Flame snuffed out
So here, for example, is a large model of a bronze sculpture, which, like Tatlin’s Tower, was never realised as a finished work
 It is a faintly Cubo-Futurist homage to Yakov Sverdlov, featuring the late Bolshevik official who died of the flu pandemic in 1918 (some historians now believe it was under Sverdlov’s direct orders that the exiled Romanovs were murdered)
 Though it pays a kind of lip-service to modernism, all the romanticised elements of Socialist Realism are already in place: Sverdlov holds aloft a torch, a cloak swirls about his heavy-set limbs, his hair is swept back and his head thrust forward, as if he is pushing against the ferocious winds of resistance with determined courage
Vera Mukhina’s Flame of the Revolution 
Vera Mukhina’s Flame of the Revolution was never finally realised, but the designs remain and a scaled-down version can be found in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow (Credit: Alamy)
Mukhina later became the premier female Socialist Realist sculptor under Stalin, winning numerous medals and awards and making the triumphal Worker and Kolkhoz Woman for the 1937 Paris World Fair, where it faced down the Nazi Pavilion’s equally monumental imperial eagle
 A hammer and sickle held aloft by the pair replaces the torch
 By then Mukhina’s has left behind all vestiges of the avant-garde
By the mid-20s, the Soviet state was already looking back over its triumphs in an effort at national mythmaking
By the mid-20s, with Lenin gone, the Soviet state was already looking back over its revolutionary triumphs in an effort at national mythmaking
 Among much that was crassly formulaic, Alexander Deineka was actually among the most surprisingly gifted of the Socialist Realists
 Despite its very obvious propaganda value, there is something almost strange and lyrical about his best known work, The Defence of Petrograd, from 1928, which looks back to the civil war and to October 1919, when the White Army had reached the city
 Frieze-like, we see exhausted soldiers trudging across an upper-level platform, while below, striding confidently in the other direction, are the sturdy workers, the heroes of the Revolution, who’ve been newly armed and are ready to die for the state
But the spirit of radical experimentation that had ignited earlier abstract artists was coming to a halt
 By the early 1930s Stalin had begun his deadly clampdown on the avant-garde, forcing Rodchenko and Malevich among many others, to renounce their ‘formalist’ ways
 In this poisonous atmosphere, artists, writers and filmmakers had their work heavily censored, their output micromanaged from above
 If they were to avoid the gulag there was no choice but to comply
 With Socialist Realism now the only officially sanctioned art, the tremendously dynamic avant-garde spirit that had guided these groundbreaking artists was sadly short-lived
There’s no denying that Cynthia Nixon looks the part as Emily Dickinson, star of Terence Davies’ stunning new film A Quiet Passion
 It’s not just the way she wears her hair – that emphatic central parting, the braided bun – or the ribbon round her neck
 The actress seems to share something of the poet’s facial features too
 But in other respects, Nixon’s portrayal is full of surprises
 You can see it even in the trailer, in which Dickinson and her mischievous proto-feminist friend, Vryling Buffam, eye up men while fluttering their fans
 Is this Dickinson or Sex and the City’s Miranda Hobbes in olden days’ garb
 It certainly isn’t how you’d imagine literature’s most famous recluse conducting herself
The cult of the 19th-Century American poet has coalesced around a very precise image, one that tells us a lot about how we view poets and how we view women poets in particular
 It’s pieced together from the most outlandish details of Dickinson’s biography: her penchant for dressing in white, her reluctance to leave her bedroom, her habit of addressing visitors through a door rather than face to face
Cynthia Nixon as Emily Dickinson

It seems to have taken hold almost as soon as her poems found their audience
 Though Dickinson wrote nearly 1,800 poems, just 10 were printed during her lifetime
 Significant publication came only after her death, aged 55, in 1886, at which point her work immediately attracted an ardent fan base
 Women readers were especially devoted, and started to make pilgrimages to the Homestead, the Dickinson’s home in Amherst, Massachusetts, which is now a museum
 Since then, the idea that such poems could have been penned by a secluded spinster toiling in recluse has proven irresistible – especially to generations of gauche, overwrought teenagers
 As Nixon puts it, Dickinson is the “patron saint of shy persons”
 It’s only part of the story, however, and Davies’ film is just one of a series of creative projects seeking to show other sides of Emily Dickinson
Truth told slant
“We were taught that she was this reclusive spinster who lived with her family, dressed all in white, and wrote in her room all day”, recalls artist Rosanna Bruno of her high school introduction to the poet in the 1980s
 Even then, Bruno felt that the mythology of the poet didn’t really mesh with the poems
 “It seemed so incongruous to what she wrote”, she says
 “Have you ever heard Helen Mirren reading Wild Nights
 You really have to rethink Dickinson as a reclusive spinster after that rendition
” 
A new book imagines Dickinson’s OKCupid profile: ‘Ethnicity: white as alabaster’
Bruno drew a cartoon of one of Dickinson’s best-known poems, Because I could not stop for Death, and when she found herself reading Dickinson’s work again while on a fellowship at the Yaddo artists’ colony in Saratoga Springs more than 20 years later, more drawings came
 The result is The Slanted Life of Emily Dickinson, a graphic novel that offers speculative glimpses of Dickinson’s social media feeds, and is published in March

Among cartoons that imagine Dickinson’s Instagram account (“@recluse1830”) and OKCupid profile (“ethnicity: white as alabaster”) are fake scholarly tomes whose titles send up our fascination with Dickinson’s personal life: Her Daily Bread: Emily Dickinson’s Silent Struggle with Gluten Intolerance, and Emily Wiccanson: The Poet and Her ‘Craft’, exploring her possible involvement in witchcraft
It’s not true that she lived in a vacuum – Carolyn Vega
Dickinson the social media star may be the stuff of satire, but as a young woman, the poet was indeed socially active
 Even later in life, she maintained and formed new friendships through her correspondence, some of which is currently on show in New York at the Morgan Library’s exhibition I’m Nobody
 Who Are You
 The Life and Poetry of Emily Dickinson
 (An accompanying program of events features a reading and recital by Patti Smith and her pianist daughter
) Its curator, Carolyn Vega, is a long-time Dickinson fan
 “While it is true that she did retreat from society, it is also true that she was deeply connected to her world through family, friendships, and literary mentors and editors
 She also read widely and was aware of political realities, including the American Civil War, that were going on around her
 It is not true that she lived in a vacuum”, Vega says
 Nor did Dickinson write in one: as the exhibition shows, she also sent out hundreds of poems to a coterie of carefully chosen friends and editors
 “She was not shy or reticent about sharing her work with them
”

To the extent that she did later opt for physical isolation, it would be a mistake to read timidity into that choice
 As Paul Hetherington, a Dickinson expert and professor of writing at the University of Canberra, notes: ‘The image of her as being a reclusive eccentric overshadows, and skews our reading of her work because it separates her from the mainstream and casts her in the role of perennial bridesmaid, unsuited to a more robust life and always working at the margins”
 In fact, he says, holing up in her father’s comfy home gave her licence, in a staunchly patriarchal society, “to speak openly about love, desire and various ideas of devotion in a way countenanced by no other 19th-Century writer
 She is in this way perhaps the first truly modern poet in the English language
”
‘Poster girl’
Writer and academic Dr Cassandra Atherton agrees
 “Dickinson’s mythology is often misread by scholars and teachers
 Far from being trapped in her father’s house, she was a subversive and brilliant poet whose rebellion can be seen in her battle against patriarchal society and its attempted containment of her as an intellectual female
”
Like Bruno and Vega, Atherton was an early convert to Dickinson’s poetry
 “Emily Dickinson was my poster girl”, she says of her teen self
 She would even go to school dressed in white with her hair parted and pulled back like the poet
 “Dickinson was a fierce observer – a role in which I felt cast as a teenager, and she took up themes concerning the importance of self, as well as pain and suffering, love and death, all essential to my experience growing up
” That infatuation hasn’t waned with adulthood – she even owns (and uses) an Emily Dickinson cookie cutter
A constructed public image can wholly obscure the true meaning of an artist’s work – Madeleine Olnek
For others, the myth is off-putting
 Playwright and film-maker Madeleine Olnek lost all interest after hearing in middle school that Dickinson was agoraphobic
 As a single university graduate, she’d tell anyone who asked that she hoped to become “the Emily Dickinson of comedy” – the joke being that Dickinson wasn’t funny
 Or so she thought
 “Later, when I started researching her, I was very, very surprised to learn that she was funny – things she said were laugh out loud funny
 And she wrote very funny things too,” she says
 “It was fascinating to me as a writer that the truth of Emily Dickinson’s life was so different [from] what the world was told about her
 This struck me as a story about the marketing of an artist, and how a constructed public image can wholly obscure the true meaning of an artist’s work
”

 is a poem first published in 1891, shown here in Dickinson’s own hand (Credit: Houghton Library, Harvard University)
Olnek has already had a play about Dickinson staged, and a film is currently in production, scheduled to wrap by early 2018
 “I don’t want to give too much away, but the movie explores the meaningful relationships that Emily forged and maintained throughout her life
 She’s always been portrayed as a loner who never came out of her room, but in fact she had loving and satisfying relationships,” she says
 It’s a drama with comic moments and Dickinson is played by none other than Saturday Night Live’s Molly Shannon
 “Molly is a performer who is sui generis, with a quick, lively mind, just like Dickinson herself
 It took a lot of nerve to write poems, to put your mind on paper – especially in the way Dickinson did, so far ahead of her time she was creating new forms – there’s an audacity to it, a subversiveness, and a willingness to cross boundaries
”
Olnek’s research, which is funded by a Guggenheim fellowship, was inspired by the use of infrared technology to access crossed out and erased words in Dickinson’s papers
 Much of this heavy editing is the work of Mabel Todd, the mistress of Dickinson’s brother, Austin
 In particular, Todd was keen to delete mentions of Dickinson’s friend – and possibly more, according to Olnek – Susan Gilbert, who also happened to be Austin’s wife
Tantalising though these discoveries are, they’re also a reminder to stick with what Dickinson left behind: her words
 And what words they are
 They’re perhaps best summed up by a quote that the Morgan Library’s Vega likes to offer from one of Dickinson’s own letters: “If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know thatis poetry
”
In 1888, a radical young painter called Georges Seurat submitted an imposing canvas to the fourth Salon des Indepéndants, an annual exhibition in the French capital showcasing revolutionary art
 It was a nocturnal scene, depicting a troupe of musicians attempting to entice passers-by to roll up, roll up, and buy tickets for a travelling circus
In the middle, on a pedestal, beneath a row of gas jets that illuminate the scene, a trombonist wearing conical headgear plays his instrument, supported by four ragtag musicians in bowler hats
 To the right, beside a buffoonish entertainer with a slicked-up quiff, a haughty ringmaster, with a puffed-out chest and impressive moustache, surveys the action
 Beneath them, members of the public, seen in silhouette, watch the show
Suerat's Circus Sideshow

Seurat probably encountered a scene just like this in the spring of 1887, when the travelling Corvi Circus set up at the Gingerbread Fair held annually on the outskirts of Paris
 Strangely, though, given the raucous nature of his subject, with loud music and a crowd of jostling onlookers, Seurat imbued the finished painting with a restrained, stately air
 More than a century after it was created, Circus Sideshow (1887-88) remains a haunting and mysterious work of art
Before the advent of cinema, the circus was one of the most popular forms of mass entertainment
 A new exhibition, Seurat’s Circus Sideshow, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, places this masterpiece in context – beside related studies as well as works by other 19th-Century artists tackling the same theme
 And it leaves us in no doubt that Seurat was far from the only modern artist fascinated by the circus

In fact, if we consider the development of modern art, it quickly becomes apparent that, like Seurat, artists from Renoir and Degas to Picasso and Matisse all felt compelled to depict the circus
To understand why, we must cast our minds back to a time, before the advent of cinema, when the circus was one of the most popular forms of mass entertainment, alongside the café-concert (the French equivalent of the music hall)
In on the act
“Absolutely everybody went to the circus,” says Richard Thomson, professor of fine art at the University of Edinburgh, and guest curator of Seurat’s Circus Sideshow at the Met
 “Working-class people went to the travelling fairs, which came on a regular basis and were very cheap
 But there were also chic circuses
 There was a circus in Paris in the 1880s, called the Cirque Molier, which was really for society people – one of the acrobats was the Duke de La Rochefoucauld
 He performed a trapeze act with an artist called Theo Wagner, who had been at the École des Beaux-Arts, the art school in Paris, with Seurat
 It was extremely fashionable
”
On a straightforward level, the appeal of the circus for artists needs little explanation: all those tumblers and clowns in bright costumes offered painters a rich, ready-made subject full of dynamism and drama
 “Artists have always been interested in the circus, because, as a visual spectacle, it’s very exciting,” explains Thomson
The Met’s show demonstrates that, long before Seurat, caricaturists such as Daumier were getting in on the act
 Like Seurat, Daumier depicted the circus ‘parade’ (or sideshow) – a temporary structure, erected outside the big top, on which acrobats and musicians performed excerpts of their acts for free, to drum up business
Honoré Daumier’s The Sideshow

Daumier drew parallels between saltimbanques – the French word for circus performers, derived from the Italian saltimbanco (someone who jumps on a bench) – and politicians, who were similarly desperate to catch the interest (and, in their case, votes) of the masses
But other factors, beyond simple spectacle, contributed to the appeal of the circus for modern artists
 “Their fascination was varied and complex,” explains Thomson, “but one aspect was that the circus was constantly changing
”
Since the Middle Ages, the circus had been an integral part of time-honoured travelling fairs, which were deeply embedded in French culture
 Beginning in the 1860s, though, impresarios in Paris and elsewhere began to capitalise on the increasing popularity of the circus by erecting permanent rings, with fixed seating
The circus' association with melancholy and alienation stirred a generation of artists 
“Circuses needed to present new spectacles to keep the punters coming in,” explains Thomson
 “And that sense of modern momentum and need for change and innovation – of being on the edge, being up to date – attracted artists who were conscious of their own modernity, and interested in the spectacle of modernity, such as Renoir and Degas
”
In 1879, for instance, Renoir painted two young female acrobats at the Cirque Fernando, a Parisian circus founded four years earlier, and situated in a working-class area at the foot of the hill of Montmartre, not far from other places of popular entertainment such as the Moulin Rouge
Miss Lala

Degas, too, frequented the Cirque Fernando
 Also in 1879, he painted one of its most sensational acts, involving an acrobat known as Miss La La, who was pulled up to the rafters of the circus dome by a rope clenched between her teeth
 The painting’s vertiginous composition, looking upwards at the acrobat, who hangs precariously in mid-air, is striking and original
“It’s a marvellous painting,” says Thomson
 “But also, I think, something of a pun – because by drawing attention to this figure going upwards, it’s like a religious painting of the Ascension
 So, it’s a bit of a joke at the expense of pious imagery from the past
”
Clowning around
While the innovations of the modern circus excited artists associated with Impressionism, such as Renoir and Degas, other aspects – chiefly, its association with melancholy and alienation – stirred the generation of artists that followed them, including Seurat
 (In 1891, Seurat died suddenly, at the age of 31, leaving behind another major, albeit unfinished, scene filled with circus entertainers
)
By way of example, Thomson mentions a group of crayon and chalk drawings of circus figures that Toulouse-Lautrec produced while undergoing treatment for alcoholism at a sanatorium on the edge of Paris in 1899
 “He made them from memory, to try and prove his mental stability,” Thomson says
 “And some of them have a slightly nightmarish quality, because they were drawn by a man who was not well
”
Moreover, by the end of the 19th Century, the notion of the sad clown was a firmly established trope
 This idea stretched all the way back to Watteau’s ambiguous 18th-Century painting of a wan and solitary Pierrot, a stock character from the Commedia dell’arte, imbued with a sense of pathos
Watteau’s Pierrot

Thomson explains: “There was a strong understanding of the myth of the sad clown – the clown or acrobat who does everything to entertain the public, and make them laugh, but is, himself, deep down inside, melancholy and alienated
”
Why was this myth so attractive for artists such as Seurat
 “Part of the fascination,” Thomson says, “was because travelling players lived on the edge
 They were people with no fixed abode, who were reliant on good weather and the goodwill of the public
 And being on the margins of society made them fragile
” He continues: “Artists identified with people on the edge of society
 The painter trying to sell work that the bourgeoisie wasn’t interested in was like a clown – doing his best to entertain, but not always succeeding
 So, circus performers became an equivalent for artists, who treated them almost autobiographically
”
Picasso’s Family of Saltimbanques 
The entertainers in Picasso’s Family of Saltimbanques are cast in a desolate landscape, a long way from the bright lights of the big top (Credit: Wikipedia)
Certainly, this is what we find in the Rose or ‘circus’ period paintings of Picasso, who also frequented the Cirque Medrano (as the Cirque Fernando was renamed around the turn of the 20th Century)
 Family of Saltimbanques (1905), for instance, is the masterpiece of Picasso’s series of paintings of melancholic itinerant circus performers, who function as symbols for the artist and his circle
 “These paintings go right back to the idea of the sad clown, and are very much about alienation and solitude,” Thomson says
Many other 20th-Century artists depicted the circus – among them Kees Van Dongen, Fernand Leger, and Georges Rouault, whose Sideshow (1907-10), is in the exhibition at the Met
 During the ‘20s, the American sculptor Alexander Calder also became enthralled by acrobats
 They inspired the Cirque Calder (1926-31) – a charming, miniaturised, mechanical sculpture-cum-replica of a circus, complete with acts including a bearded lady and a lion tamer that could ‘perform’ for an audience
 Calder travelled with this early example of performance art, which eventually filled five large suitcases
Plate from Matisse's Jazz 
Matisse’s book Jazz riffs on circus motifs and has been called “the closest thing to an autobiography that Matisse has left us” (Credit: Alamy)
One of the final flourishes of the circus as a subject in modern art, though, came in 1947, with the publication of Matisse’s spellbinding artist’s book, Jazz
 This contains 20 colour plates bursting with circus performers, including acrobats, trapeze artists, a high-wire walker, a knife-thrower, an equestrienne, a sword-swallower, a ringmaster, and a white elephant balancing on a ball
 Indeed, its original title was The Circus
In other words, Jazz – which one art historian has described as “the closest thing to an autobiography that Matisse has left us” – is a late but brilliant example of the traditional identification between artist and performer – with an additional, poignant twist: Matisse worked on the cut-paper designs for Jazz while convalescing after a life-threatening operation, which had left him an invalid in 1941
“How interesting that Matisse made Jazz right at the end of his life when he was physically frail,” says Thomson
 “And yet the imagery that he was dealing with was of gymnasts and vigorous movement
 So, ironically, given the wonderful colour of his images, there is a sense of regret and loss as well
 That double dimension – of joy and melancholy – is consistent throughout modern representations of the circus

It’s 25 years since The Silence of the Lambs became only the third film in history to win Oscars in five of the major categories: best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, best actress and best actor
 But it sometimes feels as if its diabolical anti-hero, Dr Hannibal ‘The Cannibal’ Lecter, has never been away
 Hopkins returned to the role that made him a superstar for two further films, Hannibal and Red Dragon; Gaspard Ulliel was Lecter’s younger incarnation in Hannibal Rising; and Mads Mikkelsen played him in the recent series Hannibal
 And that’s not counting all the Lecter clones in other films and television shows
(Credit: MGM)
With intense physicality and a sense of refined, unblinking madness Hopkins’ Lecter set the bar for onscreen insanity – despite only being in 16 minutes of the film (Credit: MGM)
The character may have been born in Thomas Harris’s novels, and he may have been brought to the screen by Brian Cox in 1986’s Manhunter, but it is Hopkins’ Silence of the Lambs interpretation that has been the template for dozens of other suave, sadistic, formidably brainy villains – and heroes, too
 Watch the scene in which he identifies skin cream and perfume brands by sniffing the air, and you can see where Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock Holmes came from
How many other Hollywood heroines – or heroes – are anything like Clarice
But maybe it’s about time we grew out of our Lecter fixation
 The psychotic psychiatrist is an extraordinary creation, written and performed with tremendous ghoulish panache, but ultimately he’s just another cartoon monster, with as much to do with reality as Count Dracula or Freddy Krueger
 His brave, quick-witted but vulnerable young sparring partner, Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster, is the more radical character in many ways
 And she still seems radical after a quarter of a century
(Credit: BBC/PBS)

One striking aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is the care taken by its director, Jonathan Demme, and its screenwriter, Ted Tally, to establish Starling and her well-ordered world
 A trainee FBI agent, she pounds through the Bureau’s woodland assault course at the start of the film
 Demme goes on to stage several long scenes which were shot at the actual FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, so that we can see Starling’s colleagues doing their paperwork, practising their shooting, drinking their coffee
 Most films about law-enforcement agencies have maverick protagonists: agents who either break the rules (James Bond) or turn against their nefarious handlers (Jason Bourne)
 But Silence of the Lambs has a deep respect for the FBI’s methods, and so does Starling
 She isn’t a rebel
 She doesn’t rely on intuition or luck
 She is a clever, dedicated professional who succeeds by doing everything by the book and with the encouragement of her superiors
  How many other Hollywood heroines – or heroes – are anything like her
Boys’ club
When Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), the head of the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit, sends Starling to meet Lecter in his cell at the Baltimore Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Demme moves us from her ascetic domain to his rococo one, from meticulous authenticity to nightmarish fantasy, from detective thriller to horror movie
 In the process, Demme gives Lecter one of cinema’s all-time great introductions
 The hospital’s slimy director, Dr Chilton (Anthony Heald), recounts the stomach-turning story of how Lecter ate a nurse’s tongue, and he and Starling descend from modern offices, via staircases and corridors, into a shadowy subterranean dungeon
(Credit: MGM)
Most of the characters in The Silence of the Lambs stare at Clarice Starling at one point or another – the film is very much a commentary on the ‘male gaze’ (Credit: MGM)
We’re terrified of Lecter even before we see him – and Hopkins exceeds our expectations with his statue-like stance, his reptilian winks, his teasing, sing-song voice
 I’d defy anyone to get through his first scene without wishing the Plexiglass sheet between him and Starling was several inches thicker
Silence of the Lambs is a film about what it’s like for women to be stared at by men
Lecter is so electrifying, in fact, that it’s easy to overlook what a preening, immature bore he soon reveals himself to be
 He is, of course, a snob who wants everyone to know about his taste in fine wines and expensive shoes, but he also has the grubby one-track mind of an adolescent schoolboy trying to shock his teacher
 At his initial meeting with Starling, he speculates about her upbringing, and “all those tedious, sticky fumblings in the back seats of cars”
 At his second, he asks whether Crawford “wants you sexually”
 At the third, he drools over the thought of her being abused by her mother’s cousin
 “Did the rancher make you perform fellatio
” he leers
 “Did he sodomise you
” And then when he speaks to a US senator whose daughter has been kidnapped by another serial killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), Lecter again turns into a cheeky schoolboy, ranting about the effects of breast-feeding on her nipples
 He may not have seen a women in his eight years of incarceration, but that’s no excuse for his behaving like a tabloid gossip columnist
Role model
Starling isn’t fazed
 “That doesn’t interest me, Doctor,” she says in response to one of his prurient jibes, and she goes so far as to compare him to ‘Multiple’ Miggs, the madman in a neighbouring cell who flung semen at her
 She makes a fair point
 Lecter’s male chauvinism may surface in a more sophisticated form than his fellow inmate’s, but Demme and Tally leave us in no doubt that he has more in common with Miggs than he likes to think
It might have been healthier for society if Foster’s dogged agent became as famous as Lecter
This lasciviousness isn’t confined to the asylum’s patients, either
 The film keeps reiterating that, as a young woman trying to get on with her job, Starling has to put up with advances of various kinds from the men around her: the smarmy Dr Chilton, an entomologist she consults
 (Refreshingly, she doesn’t become involved with any of them
) Demme also includes a remarkable number of shots of Starling jogging or walking, purely to show the heads turning as she passes
 More than anything else, Silence of the Lambs is a film about what it’s like for women to be stared at by men
 It’s no accident that Buffalo Bill got started as a serial killer by spying on his female neighbour, or that in his climactic showdown with Starling, he is watching her through night-vision goggles
 Amazingly, Demme fashioned both a heart-stopping chiller and a militant feminist commentary on sexual harassment and the male gaze

Demme makes it clear how isolated Clarice is in the male-dominated world of the FBI, a sense of loneliness which makes viewers identify with her all the more (Credit: MGM)
The most decent man in the film is Crawford, Starling’s boss, who isn’t trying to get his protegée into bed, despite what Lecter may imagine
 But even he can slip into sexism
 After they’ve been to examine the body of Buffalo Bill’s latest victim, Starling upbraids him for belittling her in front of the local sheriffs
 “Cops look at you to see how to act,” she explains, as resolute with Crawford as she is with Lecter
 “It matters
” The film then cuts to a shot of Starling striding through a natural history museum surrounded by dinosaur skeletons, the suggestion being that while Crawford may be progressive compared to most men, compared to her he is a dinosaur
But that, as it turned out, was wishful thinking
 Demme and his team may have hoped to usher in a new age of intelligent, independent, inspiring Hollywood heroines, but instead it was haughty homicidal maniacs who caught the public imagination
 Misogynistic dinosaurs still roam the earth
 As for Starling, she did turn up in the sequel, Hannibal, but she was treated so shabbily that Demme, Tally and Foster all turned the project down
 In place of Foster in a tracksuit, she became Julianne Moore in a frontless evening dress, and instead of keeping her distance from Lecter, she was as enthralled by him as the rest of us are
 What a waste
 It’s obvious why Hopkins’ bloodthirsty gourmand became a Halloween staple, and why he topped the American Film Institute’s list of best-ever movie villains, but it might have been healthier for society if Foster’s dogged agent had taken off in the same way
 Today, you can see versions of Hannibal Lecter every time you switch on the television
 But there’s still only one Clarice Starling

Foreign drama
One of the most exciting benefits of TV's move online has been the opening up of foreign programmes to English-speaking audiences, and in 2017, Norwegian state broadcaster NRK’s Valkyrien, about a doctor who sets up an underground clinic in a ghost station of the Oslo metro, looks set to continue the trend by being streamed on Channel 4’s Walter Presents
 The tone for Netflix’s first German-language production, Dark – a supernatural family drama that time-hops between 1968 and the present day – is sure to be similarly sepulchral and another Norwegian show, Acquitted, which returns in 2017 for a second season, is haunting and intriguing, but hardly cheerful
 The first series of this ambiguous homecoming drama set amid fjords and mountains set viewing records when it was broadcast two years ago by the country’s main commercial broadcaster TV2

Literary adaptations
It’s a mark of the artistic credibility TV now possesses that some of the most talked about literary adaptations of the next 12 months won’t be seen in cinemas but on the small screen
 There’s a third series of the BBC smash Poldark, about the trials and tribulations of an often shirtless, wheat-threshing Revolutionary War veteran after returning to his native Cornwall
 But there are also many adaptations of sci-fi and fantasy books this year
 The acclaimed producer of Hannibal and Pushing Daisies, Bryan Fuller, is turning Neil Gaiman’s American Gods (Starz) into a lush spectacle starring Ian McShane as the god Odin in a mythopoetic US where deities like Loki, Anubis, and Czernobog still exist but try to blend in with ordinary people
 Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel about a future where women are only valued for reproduction, The Handmaid’s Tale (Hulu), arrives on the box with Elisabeth Moss as Offred, a handmaid who’s been assigned to bear children for a military leader
 Len Deighton’s SS-GB, which imagines what would have happened if Britain had surrendered to Nazi Germany in World War Two, will be the BBC’s answer to Amazon’s The Man in the High Castle – it’s scripted by long-time James Bond screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade
 And Netflix’s A Series of Unfortunate Events is based on the children’s book series by Lemony Snicket but has received major praise for its adult themes and unique Gothic absurdist tone
 Then there’s a series that breaks all genre classifications: I Love Dick (Amazon), based on Chris Kraus’s 1997 novel-memoir hybrid, which brings Kathryn Hahn and Kevin Bacon to TV as an artist and the media theorist she’s obsessed with
 Perhaps there is no greater sign of TV’s cultural ascent than the migration of movie stars in its direction: Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley and Laura Dern appear in HBO’s adaptation of Liane Moriarty’s 2014 novel Big Little Lies, about women who become friends and discover the ways in which violence has affected their lives
Is there a more life-affirming action one can take than to leap
 When the American astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon, he immediately cast the “small step” he’d taken in the sprightly language of a “leap”
 Leaping is how, in a single bound, superheroes conquer tall buildings and how the rest of us respond to lucky breaks
 We don’t hop at life’s chances, we leap at them
 Progress is never measured in titanic vaults, but in quantum leaps
 When the Romantic poet William Wordsworth was deeply moved by the evaporative sight of a rainbow, his spleen didn’t shiver; his heart leapt up
 And when we’re tired of waiting for the right moment to act and are finally ready to make our move, we don’t mosey into motion; we leap into action

Leaping alters us from passive spectator on life to active agent in it
 Acrobatic images captured this week in Bangladesh of rail passengers leaping from train to train in the town of Tongi, on the outskirts of Dhaka, seem to embody the very essence of existential leaping
 Making their way to the Biswa Ijtema, the world’s second-largest gathering of Muslims after the Hajj, the spry commuters who bounded energetically from carriage to carriage appeared to exemplify the devotional verve that the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard famously described not, as is often misremembered, a “leap of faith” but rather a “leap to faith”
Such exuberant bounding is, needless to say, propelled by boundless confidence that there will be space for a safe landing on the other side
 The terrifying prospect that there is no stable ground on the other side of that abyss calls to mind another memorable photo, one created at a moment in cultural history when lasting world peace seemed equally unpredictable

For the photomontage Leap into the Void, Yves Klein was photographed by the duo Harry Shunk and János Kender, known as Shunk-Kender (Credit: Wikimedia)
French post-War artist Yves Klein’s photomontage Le Saut dans le Vide (Leap into the Void), which Klein spliced together in October 1960, shows the artist hurling himself precariously from a Parisian window – his lobbed body frozen forever on the verge either of taking flight or of plummeting perilously to the pavement below
 Perceived by some as a comment on Nasa’s (at the time) lofty ambition to reach the moon and by others as a response to the accelerating iciness of Cold War relations, Klein’s Leap into the Void captured for many the dicey mood of the moment

“I look for colours that… say something to me – that make a statement,” says Academy Award winning make-up designer Michèle Burke in this video
 “I look at the face or I look at the character, and I think ‘what is the first thing I want them to look at

Burke has created such looks as Tom Cruise’s battered face in Vanilla Sky, Mike Myers’s bald-headed Dr Evil in Austin Powers and the ethereal bright-eyed Brad Pitt in Interview with the Vampire
 “I look at the totality of the person – the hair, the skin tone,” she says

 Although Ai Weiwei’s monumental new artwork is as light as air, its subject matter is heavy
Ai Weiwei is himself a refugee and in recent years he has turned his attention to the subject of displaced people
 In 2015, he wrapped the columns of Berlin’s Konzerthaus concert hall in hundreds of bright orange life vests
 He is currently working on a film, The Human Flow, which will be presented later this year
The installation of this new artwork in Prague is pointed: the government of the Czech Republic, like many other central European countries, has reacted angrily against the influx of refugees since 2015 and the EU’s system of quotas to accept them
 "I say clearly that I don't want even a single refugee in the Czech Republic, not even temporarily," Deputy Prime Minister Andrej Babis wrote in August 2015
As he walks around the new work, Ai tells Rob Cameron that the Czech government’s attitude is “by any means not acceptable because it’s morally wrong
 It’s short-sighted
 It’s a coward’s behavior
”
“In this time of uncertainty, we need more tolerance, compassion and trust for each other since we all are one
 Otherwise, humanity will face an even bigger crisis” Ai added in a statement
 Disney has recently been remaking its hits with the industrial efficiency of a car manufacturing plant, but most of these updates have had their own identity
 Maleficent turned the villainess of Sleeping Beauty into its heroine, for instance
 The Jungle Book put some Rudyard Kipling back into the mix
 And Pete’s Dragon didn’t take much from the 1977 model except the title
 But the ‘new’ film of Beauty and the Beast is the first of these Disney remakes to take the opposite approach, and to copy its source material in every possible way
The story is the same as it was in the much-loved 1991 cartoon, the characters are the same, even Belle’s costumes are the same: blue dress and white blouse at the start, yellow ball gown later on
 And it is amazing to see that IMDb credits the screenplay to Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulis, as opposed to Linda Woolverton, who wrote the original, because much of the dialogue is identical
 You have to go back to Gus van Sant’s shot-for-shot homage to Psycho to see a film which gives you such a startling sense of déjà vu
There are two obvious differences between the two versions, however
 The first difference is that the current film is live-action, so there are lots of rococo sets and intricate digital creations to look at
 And yet, despite the zillions of dollars that must have been spent on the Hogwarts-ish production design, the sad fact is that neither of the showstopping numbers, the title song and Be Our Guest, is as magical or imaginative as it was in a cartoon which came out over a quarter of a century ago
Few of the actors live up to their predecessors, either
 Buried as he is under layers of computer-generated imagery, Dan Stevens manages to make the Beast his own by finding the pathos in his aristocratic awkwardness
 Ewan McGregor puts some oomph and ooh-la-la into Lumiere the candelabra
 As for the rest of the cast, Emma Watson is prim and petulant as Belle; Emma Thompson’s Mrs Potts is no match for Angela Lansbury’s, who was as warm and soothing as the tea she brewed; and Kevin Kline is painfully mannered as Belle’s wittering father
 In many cases, what it comes down to is that the voices in the cartoon were provided by musical and opera veterans who could really sing, whereas the same characters in the live-action film are played by movie stars who really can’t
Beast of burden
The second difference between the two Beauty and the Beasts is that the new one is longer than the old one
 The director, Bill Condon, has taken a fairy-tale romance which skipped along for 84 minutes and made it into a drama which trudges along for a tiresome 129
 Some of the additions are well-judged
 In the prologue, the prince has become a sneering brat who throws decadent, Marie Antoinette-rivalling parties at the expense of his impoverished subjects, so when an enchantress transforms him into a fanged and furry monster, the curse doesn’t seem as unjust as it once did
 We also learn why the braggadocious huntsman, Gaston (an amusing Luke Evans), is so keen on the village’s resident bookworm
 Apparently he misses the thrill of his wartime exploits, and being knocked back by the condescending Belle is the closest he now gets to dodging musket balls
In a way, watching Beauty and the Beast is like watching the extended cut of Apocalypse Now
But the film-makers’ other efforts to fill in the cartoon’s blanks are much less welcome
 Beauty and the Beast follows the tedious example of the latest Batman and Bond blockbusters by explaining every last facet of its characters’ history and psychology - and, as in Batman, the deaths of parents are a major factor
 The result is that there are several speeches, along with several new songs, which serve only to make the whole enterprise slower and gloomier
 It’s a fatal flaw
 The plot hinges on the idea that if Belle and her hirsute suitor don’t fall in love by the time the petals fall from an enchanted rose, he will be trapped in his shaggy form forever
 But the film moves at such a dragging pace that it feels as if the rose would have withered and died with another three songs to go
In a way, watching Beauty and the Beast is like watching the extended cut of Apocalypse Now, in that it’s interesting to see all the extra scenes that have been slotted into a classic film, but it’s obvious why they were omitted in the first place
 Its very fidelity to the cartoon is what will appeal to some viewers, however
 Just as young fans of the Harry Potter novels judged the first films not on how well they worked in cinematic terms, but on how slavishly faithful they were to the books, young fans of Beauty and the Beast may be pleased to see so many of their favourite moments recreated – and with Hermione in them to boot
 At the other extreme, there are those poor individuals who have never seen the original – the first ever animated film to be nominated for a best picture Oscar – so they will find much to delight them even in its pale imitation
But while the new film isn’t terrible, it’s difficult to see what the point of it is as long as the cartoon exists
 Beauty and the Beast is simply a cover version of a chart-topping song, played with such anonymous competence that Condon’s motto must have been, “It ain’t broke, don’t fix it
” Another motto might have been better: “If it ain’t broke, don’t remake it
”People love a good underdog story, especially when it plays into a belief in our best natures
 Witness the recent Oscar night best picture snafu involving Moonlight and La La Land, which briefly had the air of a disputed prizefight before the now-infamous envelope mix-up was resolved
 A morning-after cover story in Variety, the influential Hollywood trade magazine, solidified the official narrative that people in Tinseltown really can put aside differences to get along
 Yet there’s something about camaraderie that doesn't have quite the allure of bad blood, perhaps because it’s easier to believe that people are, at heart, more likely to trade barbs and blows than hugs and kisses
The feud is a prism through which to look at the women’s status in Hollywood
Which brings us to the new US TV series Feud: Bette and Joan, a breezily entertaining eight-episode dissection of the tempestuous relationship between Hollywood Golden Age superstars Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon) and Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange), which purportedly came to a boil on the set of their only film together, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane
 in 1962
 Purportedly is the right word to use here because, as critic and Crawford/Davis expert Farran Smith Nehme suggests in a wide-ranging recent interview with MTV News’s Inkoo Kang, the actresses’ feud has become regarded as fact, when it may really be trumped up
 Myth and truth are so intertwined that they may be impossible to untangle
 But as Nehme says, “Everybody loves a catfight,” and the series – at least in the five episodes made available for preview – more than follows through on that
(Credit: Warner Bros)
What Ever Happened to Baby Jane

It can still be fun to compare and contrast the various fictions and shreds of fact surrounding Davis, Crawford and Baby Jane – many of which are recounted in Shaun Considine’s 1989 book Bette & Joan: The Divine Feud, which Nehme notes is “very lively” but also “very erratically sourced”
 Take all of the tales about Davis and Crawford with a grain of salt, from their reported dueling romantic trysts with the actor Franchot Tone in the 1930s to their catty back-and-forth exchanges in gossip rags
 “You know who The Star was written about, don't you
” Davis is reported to have said of the 1952 film in which she played a washed-up movie queen
 “Joan Crawford”
 But there is some truth buried within all the exaggerations
(Credit: Alamy)
Crawford won an Oscar for Mildred Pierce but feigned illness and was hospitalised because she thought she would lose

What can be stated with absolute certainty is that Feud’s producer, Ryan Murphy, embraces the many legends of the Crawford/Davis rivalry and uses them as a prism through which to reflect – sometimes successfully, sometimes not – on the status of women in what was then and still remains a male-dominated industry
 As the series presents it, this feud is an idea more than a historic reality, a critical lens on the way in which women in Hollywood can be seen as powerful – and how they need an adversary to demonstrate their potency
 If the feud didn’t exist (and it may not have to the extent Hollywood has made out) it would have been necessary to invent it
Battle royale
There is no doubt that Joan and Bette were often flavours of the month one year, box office poison the next, and, that prior to their working together, each already had a major comeback film: Mildred Pierce for Joan in 1945, All About Eve for Bette in 1950
 Though Feud the TV series mainly takes place in the 1960s, focusing on the actresses prepping for, filming, and dealing with the overwhelming reaction to What Ever Happened to Baby Jane
, Murphy and company have fun teasing viewers with flashback glimpses of Davis and Crawford navigating the many tiers of Old Hollywood
 Among the highlights, Sarandon gets to put her own ‘Bette Davis eyes’ to use in a recreation of the famous stairway death scene in The Little Foxes (1941)
 Lange, as Crawford, gets to do some temperamental acting-out on the set of the 1943 spy thriller Above Suspicion, breaking character and complaining to director Richard Thorpe about the inane script
Whatever Baby Jane rumours you've heard are recreated adoringly in the series
There’s a sense that both women are on separate but similar quests to prove themselves, or, perhaps to thicken their skins and survive in the high-testosterone Hollywood of the time
 Davis, in particular, had a notoriously fraught relationship with Warner Bros studio head Jack Warner (played by a flamboyantly virile Stanley Tucci in the series), resulting from a 1936 contract dispute
 Warner would go on to release Baby Jane, despite some protestation and, so Feud suggests, some more-than-lingering enmity about that previous conflict with Davis
 If there's any impression in these flashback scenes that the women themselves are at odds, it’s mainly in the fact that they're both combatants in the same war for acceptance and success
 It suggests that the feud was merely an assumption, a bit of drama the audience craved and which was manufactured to satisfy that craving and fuel their interest

Considine’s book suggests Crawford courted Davis to appear alongside her in Baby Jane
 In the TV series Crawford discovers the novel herself – it is not brought to her attention by the film’s eventual director Robert Aldrich as Considine’s book reports
 It’s clear that the series is tilting the ‘truth’ of the situation toward a more feminist perspective – the woman taking complete agency
(Credit: Wikipedia)
Davis biographer Ed Sikov reports she posted this want ad looking for work in Hollywood trade magazines nine days after Baby Jane wrapped (Credit: Wikipedia)
Crawford, in the series as in the book, approaches Davis to discuss co-starring in the film backstage at the Broadway theatre where the latter is playing a supporting role in Tennessee Williams’s The Night of the Iguana
 Sarandon’s Davis gives some sublimely squinted side-eye to Lange’s Crawford as she insists that she’s always wanted to work together
 In a later scene, both Sarandon and Lange dance hilarious pas de deux of one-upsmanship as they recreate the famous photo of the two actresses signing the Baby Jane contracts – Crawford towering over a seated Davis, both actresses’ beaming eyes and plastic smiles barely concealing the simmering tensions underneath
Armistice day
Feud gets to the set of the film midway through the first episode, where the series remains until episode three
 This is, of course, where much of the juicy stuff is reported to have happened, from Davis intentionally kicking Crawford in the head (“I barely touched her
” seethes Sarandon) to Crawford wearing weights under her costume so that Davis, who had to drag her across the set in one scene, threw her back out
 Basically, whatever rumours you’ve heard about the production are recreated adoringly in the series – Sarandon even gets to venomously spit out the famous line “But you are, Blanche
 You are in that chair
” –  though there are further speculative additions as well
It’s a perfect storm of rancour and spite
Chief among these are Davis’s one-night-stand with Aldrich (a superbly harried Alfred Molina), which feels like it’s been added, not ineffectually, simply to stretch out the drama, as well as to further the series’ thesis about the high price women have had to pay in the Tinseltown boys club
 And Crawford’s close friendship with gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (the great Judy Davis), who is as much therapist as exploiter to the Baby Jane co-star, is an invention that somehow still feels accurate in this context
 The duo’s chummy relationship reveals the parasitic nature of art and commerce, and how anyone, regardless of gender, could spin certain slanderous tidbits to their liking
(Credit: Alamy)
Crawford insisted that she accept the Oscar onstage for an absent Anne Bancroft, Davis’s rival for best actress in 1963, to protest Davis’ nomination (Credit: Alamy)
The drama doesn’t stop after the series moves on from the production of Baby Jane, which became a big hit, reintroducing Crawford and Davis to a new generation
 There are asides based on fact involving Crawford’s attendance at a successful preview of the film, as well as a steely ‘looking for work’ ad that Davis placed in a trade publication after the success of Baby Jane didn't immediately translate into more film offers, a pointed call-out of the industry's and ageism
 And in the fifth episode, what will probably rank as Feud's highlight installment, Murphy and company recreate, in excruciating detail, the infamous 1963 Oscars ceremony where Bette was up for best actress, but Joan was not
Revenge is a dish best served cold, and both the series and Considine’s book detail an icy plot by Joan to rob Davis of her moment of glory
 Crawford butters up two other nominees, Geraldine Page (Sarah Paulson) and Anne Bancroft (Serinda Swan), insisting that she’ll act as their onstage proxy at the ceremony should they win, since neither ended up attending
 And on the night, Crawford swans her way around the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, defiantly taking over the green room, turning a cold shoulder to Davis, and, finally sweeping past her Baby Jane co-star to accept the absent Bancroft’s gold statuette for The Miracle Worker
 It’s a perfect storm of rancour and spite, the very flip side of the conciliatory Oscar competition between Moonlight and La La Land
 There’s something to be said, however, for the way the malevolence and insincerity pulsing under every scene of Feud has a smidge more enticement – perhaps that lure is why many outside observers tried to play up the race for best picture between Moonlight and La La Land as a more heated battle than anyone actually involved with either film thought it to be
 It’s easier to be bad than good, to be false rather than true
 Ultimately, however, like a certain pair of stars, you can’t have one without the other
In his relatively short life – he died at the age of 35 – Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed over 600 works
 A child prodigy, Mozart began composing at a very young age, and his symphonies, concertos, choral and operatic works are considered some of the greatest in history
But although his genius is unquestionable, for the unfamiliar, Mozart’s formidable reputation and the scale of his output can be off-putting
What would happen if you tried to listen to everything he ever wrote
 That’s exactly what music journalist Alex Marshall – a Mozart novice – challenged himself to do, to discover what all the fuss was about
 He took delivery of 200 CDs of Mozart’s music and set about his mammoth task
What does constant listening of anything – let alone 200 CDs – do to a person

Julian Rosefeldt’s Manifesto may not know what it believes in, but it believes in Cate Blanchett
 In this film, which began life as a multichannel video installation, Blanchett plays 13 roles, from a turbaned choreographer to a nuclear scientist, with all of her dialogue spliced together from nearly 60 artistic manifestos of the 20th Century
 A prim housewife recites Claes Oldenburg as the preface to a family meal in lieu of grace; a CEO greets the guests at her party with excerpts from Vassily Kandinsky and Barnett Newman
In its incarnation as an art installation, mounted in Melbourne, Berlin and, most recently, New York City, Manifestoallowed viewers to wander freely among its dozen tableaux, each projected on its own screen
 This ‘linear version’, as it’s called, trims more than two hours of footage to less than 90 minutes (not counting credits), and the scenes are intercut to create a patchwork
Rosefeldt’s interest is in a manifesto’s form rather than its substance
Although these scenes – which have titles like “Stridentism/Creationism (the punk rocker)” and “Vorticism/Blue Rider/Abstract/Expressionism (the CEO)” – are organised roughly by category, Rosefeldt’s interest is in a manifesto’s form rather than its substance
 “To put out a manifesto, you must want,” says Blanchett, quoting the surrealist Philippe Soupault, intones over the image of a fuse sputtering in the darkness, “to organise prose into a form of absolute and irrefutable evidence
” 
It’s the “want” that concerns Manifesto, not the evidence
 By slicing and dicing his source material, and by further recombining the scenes in the film version, Rosefeldt makes it impossible to lay hold of a coherent train of thought
 What remains is the language of the manifesto – exhortatory, idealistic, sometimes violent – but not its overriding philosophy or the art it was meant to inspire: its style, not its substance
One of her accents exists nowhere on Earth outside a beginners’ acting workshop
Manifesto’s visual inventiveness and Blanchett’s multifarious performances make the movie consistently engrossing, even when the relationship between Blanchett’s character and the words coming out of her mouth – or, more often in this version, spoken by her in voiceover – seem purely arbitrary
Making a statement
Some of the characters, too, are more fully conceived than others: her sneering, Sid Vicious-style punk singer is a cringe-inducing embarrassment, and the comically nasal drawl she gives the stockbroker who lays out the principles of Futurism emanates from nowhere on Earth outside a beginners’ acting workshop
 The charitable interpretation is it’s deliberately fake, part of a performance designed to highlight the segment’s artificiality; the less charitable is that Blanchett shot the 12 scenes in 11 days and that was one of the ones she didn’t rehearse
 It’s diverting for a while to see Blanchett done up as a homeless man, wandering through industrial rubble as she shouts Situationist dogma at the lens in a Scottish accent, but there’s nothing to it beyond technique
Blanchett is at her best with the characters who are erudite, middle or upper class: a CEO, a TV news reader, a primary-school teacher
 The latter two, which Rosefeldt wisely holds for last, are the highlights, the roles in which Blanchett seems to be playing a fully fledged person and not a concatenation of actorly tics and costume design
 The news reader lays out the tenets of conceptual art, as laid down by Sol Lewitt and others, in a hectoring voice that conveys authority without understanding; then she throws the conversation to her weather forecaster, also played by Blanchett, standing outside in a downpour
 Their “Over to you, Cate,” “Thank you, Cate” back-and-forth is the most fun Blanchett’s had acting opposite herself since Jim Jarmusch’s Coffee & Cigarettes
 In the final segment, Blanchett is a teacher, patiently schooling a classroom full of scribbling children in the ideas of Jean-Luc Godard and the Dogme 95 manifesto as she paces the rows of desks in pleated slacks
 Perhaps it’s telling that Manifesto’s best segments extol the virtues of conceptual art, in which, as Lewitt-via-Blanchett puts it, the idea behind the work is far more important that its execution, and artistic appropriation, via the (probably apocryphal) Godard dictum, “It’s not where you take things from; it’s where you take them to
” Manifesto has plenty of concepts, even if they’re mostly borrowed, but manifestos are meant to inspire action, and this one only aims to impress
In art, as in life, sometimes it is hard to see the wood for the weed
 Such was the case on New Year’s day, when a team of still-unapprehended vandals forced southern Californians to do a double-take as they glanced up to the Santa Monica mountains
 Eluding security and using nothing more than a few white sheets and black banners, the mischief-makers managed deftly to alter the famous hillside sign that looms iconically over Los Angeles into a momentary celebration of a new law that makes recreational use of marijuana legal

Suddenly, the high life being trumpeted from the Hollywood Hills was no longer the glitz of Tinseltown, but the spliffs of “Hollyweed”
 More a playful prank than an act of enduring defacement, the sly sleight of eye that innocently nudged the Os into Es reminds us, nevertheless, just how easy it is to hijack a cultural symbol and commandeer its meaning
 As it happens, that reminder was eerily timed
 The following day, on 2 January, the writer responsible for helping make audiences aware of how vulnerable cultural icons are to manipulation – the British art critic and Booker-prize winning novelist John Berger – died in Paris at the age of 90
Berger became a household name in 1972 when, in the opening scene of his now legendary BBC mini-series on Western art, Ways of Seeing, he forced viewers watching at home to do a double-take
 Sporting a 70’s shirt and a disco hairdo, Berger strode confidently up to a masterpiece by the Italian Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli, pulled out a box cutter, and began tearing violently into the 15th-Century masterpiece until he’d prised the head of Venus from the canvas
 That Berger was attacking a copy and not the original hardly made a difference to the aghast viewers, who were accustomed to watching posh historians relate to works of art as if they were sacred relics

Berger’s irreverent assault was intended to illustrate how those who control the images that we consume in books and films, magazines and ads, invariably destroy the meaning of those works for their own political and economic ends (ideas he’d adopted from the German philosopher Walter Benjamin’s seminal 1935 essay The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction)
 By changing the way popular audiences responded to the use of works of art by those with the power to reproduce them, Berger changed the way we see – leaving the eyes of his audience as wide open as a pair of unadulterated Os in the Hollywood sign
Terrence Malick made a masterpiece, Days of Heaven, nearly 40 years ago, and that film’s outsized shadow has unfairly haunted his career ever since
 What could possibly measure up
 Today the film remains as eloquent as ever, timeless and purely Malick
 A romantic triangle plays out in a drama of love, jealousy, desire and treachery against the visually stunning landscape of an early 20th Century Texas farm, the story shaped by a young girl’s voiceover
It’s as contemporary as a film shot five years ago can be
Malick didn’t make another movie for 20 years, then returned with a quickening pace
 But in his most recent work, the approach derived from Days of Heaven has curdled
 To the Wonder (2013) and Knight of Cups (2016) are poetic essays, full of stunning imagery and philosophical questions in voiceover
 But even judged as poetry they are more vapid than effective, full of posing and pouting
 To The Wonder could play as spot-on self-parody, as a morose Ben Affleck and his French bride wander through the open spaces of Oklahoma, speaking overblown lines
 Knight of Cups is nearly unwatchable, with Christian Bale as a degenerate Hollywood screenwriter who floats though clichéd party scenes and ponders daddy issues
The new drama, Song to Song, is lesser Malick compared to his finest work, but succeeds in being smart and engaging for at least its first half
 In To the Wonder and Knight of Cups, characters vanish under all that puffed-up philosophising
 Song to Song tethers itself to reality with another romantic triangle, this time set against the contemporary backdrop of the music scene in Austin, Texas
 Or as contemporary as a film shot five years ago can be
 Taking years with his edits is another Malick trademark
Rooney Mara is the central figure, Faye, a would-be musician
 She sleeps with Cook, a record producer played by Michael Fassbender, hoping to further her career
 They knowingly use each other, until she falls for Ryan Gosling as BV, a songwriter who is Cook’s protégé at first, but who breaks with him after Cook steals his copyrights
 Faye hides her continuing relationship with Cook from her new love, creating a swirl of ethical dilemmas
The actors make these characters vivid, within a structure that is recognisably Malick’s
 Faye describes the strategy in voiceover: “I thought we could just roll and tumble, live from song to song, kiss to kiss
” The film mirrors that approach
 It is built on fragments, disconnected moments of time, seen from various characters’ perspectives and with more voiceover than dialogue
 There are Faye and Cook in his bedroom, Faye and BV in one of a series of opulent places she housesits (the shifting locations create a sense of a character adrift)
 Backstage at concerts, Cook stands next to Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine or chats over a glass of wine with Iggy Pop
 Eventually, BV questions Faye about her relationship with Cook
 She responds with a series of lies
 Although Faye realizes that living song to song cannot work forever, the film uses the tactic to good effect, piecing together a cogent story of love and deception
To the wonder
Malick’s typical nature imagery, used as interstitial scenes and easily parodied, is replaced here by scenes of music festivals, including SXSW and the Austin City Limits Festival
 The music turns out to be no more than set decoration, despite a parade of familiar names and faces
 We rarely hear more than a few lines of any performance: the Black Lips here, Iggy Pop there
 Once, Faye turns up on stage with a guitar but we never hear a lick
 We can only guess what kind of music BV writes – quasi-country maybe
 Among many, Patti Smith’s is the only one that matters
 She plays a version of her down-to-earth self, giving Faye advice and singing My Blakean Year
Emmanuel Lubezki (known for Gravity, Birdman and The Revenant) has been Malick’s cinematographer since The New World (2005)
 Here he gives Austin a gleaming look, yet the visuals never become an overwhelming distraction
The inflated bad-poetry style of weaker Malick films is minimised  
Fassbender and Gosling are great fits for the film, each adding the energy and charisma that is so often missing from Malick’s work
 Fassbender brings honesty to his character’s transparently evil, self-destructive nature
 Gosling is charmingly boyish, and convincing when it turns out BV is not as naive as he first appears
Mara is another story
 She starts out well enough, her hair in a schoolgirl ponytail that disguises Faye’s steely ambition
 As the film goes on, Mara (rather than her character) becomes one-note and tiresome
 We lose patience with Faye just when we should be empathising with her
In the second half of Song to Song, Malick expands the circle of characters
 Cook takes up with a waitress played by Natalie Portman, who brings a sad elegance to an underwritten role
 BV deals, in short episodes, with his family (Linda Emond as his mother and Tom Sturridge as his brother), a new love played by Cate Blanchett, and an ex-girlfriend, played by the musician Lykke Li
 Her scenes with Gosling are strong, and include a lively scene in which they dance to Del Shannon’s Runaway
Responses to the new film at its SXSW premiere recently were mostly vicious
Despite its weaknesses, Song to Song stands as Malick’s best since The Tree of Life, (2011), an eloquent memory piece about family and loss that largely worked
 Responses to the new film when it premiered at SXSW recently were mostly vicious, almost annoyed at Malick for no longer being his Days of Heaven self, an unreasonable standard
 The only way to judge him is on his own, 21st Century, experimental terms
Those terms come sharply into focus when you consider that the original title of Song to Song was Weightless, which, Malick said at SXSW, comes from Virginia Woolf
 In her novel The Waves, a character wonders how to go on “without a self, weightless and visionless, through a world weightless, without illusion
” Like Malick’s recent work, The Waves is more a poem than a story
 Substitute voiceovers for literary monologues and you have an exact model of a Malick film
 And like Song to Song, Woolf’s novel raises the open-ended question of whether the fragments of a life can ever coalesce into a whole
The Waves is not Woolf’s most accessible or popular work, and Song to Song is not likely to be Malick’s
 But it reveals a true artist still at work
This feel-good drama about three unsung heroes topped the US box office on inauguration weekend, and has since nabbed Academy Awards nominations for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay
 In an era of segregation, African-American women Katherine Johnson (Taraji P Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer – who received the nomination) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) calculated the mathematical data needed to launch Nasa’s first successful space missions
 Directed by Theodore Melfi and based on a true story, the film is an ensemble piece, with a cast including Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst and Mahershala Ali in “a mash-up of the space race and civil rights that serves both well”
 Screenwriter Allison Schroeder – who grew up at Cape Canaveral, and whose grandmother was a computer programmer at Nasa – has crafted a film that’s “both a dazzling piece of entertainment and a window into history”, according to Time magazine
 Released 2 February in Brazil and Germany and 23 February in Singapore

Oscar-winning writer-director Asghar Farhadi (A Separation) returns to Iran with The Salesman, which has picked up a Best Foreign Language Film nomination in this year’s Academy Awards
 Shahab Hosseini and Taraneh Alidoosti star as a husband and wife in Tehran navigating marriage problems while performing in a production of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman
 Forced to leave their apartment, which is in danger of collapsing, they struggle to cope after a mysterious assault
 “With every shot, our sympathies flicker and tilt”, says The New Yorker, while The Chicago Reader praises Farhadi for privileging “a woman's viewpoint without either sharing or exploring it”
 Released 2 February in the Czech Republic and Germany and 23 February in Argentina
Land of Mine

Another Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, this tense Danish drama delivers “a classic wide-screen World War Two epic… with a number of unsettling twists”, according to the LA Times
 Writer-director Martin Zandvliet’s third feature tells the story of a group of German POWs forced to remove landmines from a stretch of beach at the war’s end
 According to Variety, “Zandvliet’s script and direction avoid milking an innately loaded situation for excess melodrama or pathos, sticking to a discreet economy of approach that accumulates considerable power”
 Released 9 February in Greece and 17 February in the US
The Great Wall

Critics have been mixed about this Chinese-US blockbuster from acclaimed director Zhang Yimou, with Singapore’s Strait Times calling the epic an “attempt at Hollywood capitalism with Chinese characteristics”
 Backed by a Chinese-owned Hollywood studio, The Great Wall is the most expensive film ever made in China, which is expected to become the world’s largest film biggest market by 2019, and there have been doubts over its cultural sensitivity
 Yet some reviews have been positive, with The Guardian saying “Simultaneously futuristic and historic, the visual spectacle carries the film… the director’s artistic touch is on display in his long panoramic sweeps and artful use of colour”
 Matt Damon stars as an Irish mercenary alongside Andy Lau and Jing Tian in a film that looks at China’s relationship with foreigners – without being too heavy-handed
 According to the South China Morning Post, “Zhang appears to remember that he is delivering fantasy entertainment, not a political manifesto”
 Released 16 February in Russia and Australia and 17 February in the US
I am not Your Negro

Billed as “a journey into black history that connects the past of the Civil Rights movement to the present of #BlackLivesMatter”, this documentary from film-maker Raoul Peck (Sometimes in April) imagines an unfinished book by James Baldwin
 At the time of his death in 1987, the writer left 30 pages describing an assignment he turned down in the late ‘70s
 They outlined a personal account of the lives and assassinations of three of his close friends, the civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr
 Weaving Baldwin’s words (narrated by Samuel L Jackson) with archive footage, Peck “makes a persuasive, intuitive case for Baldwin as a poet and a prophet”
 He also makes connections between the past and present, opening with a montage of photos from Ferguson, Missouri and of Tamir Rice and Trayvon Martin
 According to The New Yorker, “Peck’s references to current events reveal Baldwin’s view of history and his prophetic visions to be painfully accurate”
 Released 3 February in the US, 17 March in Sweden
The Space Between Us

Peter Chelsom (Hector and the Search for Happiness) directs an interplanetary adventure tackling a perennial young adult topic with a cosmic spin
 The Space Between Us stars Asa Butterfield as a teenage boy who was born on Mars when an astronaut discovered she was pregnant en route to the red planet
 After beginning an online friendship with a girl called Tulsa (Britt Robertson), he travels to Earth but discovers his organs can’t survive there
 Running out of time, he goes on a road trip with Tulsa in search of his father
 In an interview, Butterfield described how the film doesn’t fit one genre: “It’s kind of got a sci-fi element
 It’s a road trip
 It’s a love story
 I think, most of all, it’s a coming-of-age film about this boy learning to be human and finding out where he belongs
” Released 3 February in Canada, 9 February in Germany and 16 February in Hong Kong

Arrested Development alumni Will Arnett and Michael Cera co-star as Batman and Robin in this spin-off from 2014’s The Lego Movie
 Rosario Dawson is Batgirl (who in this role is also Gotham City’s female Police Commissioner), Siri plays the batcave computer and Ralph Fiennes is Alfred Pennyworth in what director Chris McKay has called “a critique of the Batman character”
 In a panel discussion, he said “we wanted to take a look at how absurd this guy is… The thing that he does to fix the hole in his heart is to go out and learn karate and dress up like a bat and fight criminals at night
” That said, Arnett’s reprisal of the role looks to be a more sympathetic take than the pompous character in The Lego Movie – in the trailer, he sits by himself in his mansion attempting to synch his gadgets
 On general release from 9 February

An artform made famous in Madonna’s 1990 Vogue music video has seen a revival in recent years, and some of the scene’s key figures appear in a documentary combining personal stories with exuberant dance performances
 Jennie Livingston offered an inside look at New York’s ballroom culture in her landmark film Paris is Burning, which won the grand jury prize at Sundance in 1991, and this film from director and co-writer Sara Jordenö and co-writer Twiggy Pucci Garçon shows a new subculture combining art with activism
 According to The New York Times, “Kiki fluidly combines interviews with on-the-street and dance-floor scenes to create an exhilarating, multifaceted portrait of ballroom participants, a number of whom are LGBT activists”
 Following seven characters from the Kiki community over the course of four years, Swedish film-maker Jordenö looks at the lives of the youth outside the dances to create “a kaleidoscopic and vivid rendering of a world that is larger than life, flamboyant but ultimately fragile”
 Released 24 February in the US and online
Every word conceals a story, a secret history
 Behind the syllables we use every day lurk countless forgotten tales
 “If you know the origin of a word”, the 6th Century scholar Isidore of Seville insisted, “everything can be more clearly comprehended”
 While most words slip into currency inconspicuously and without leaving traceable trails of their journeys, there is an elite class of verbal inventions whose exact dates of initial utterance have indeed been carefully recorded
Some of these words are the one-off brainchildren of individuals who have long faded into the fog of history
 Others are the concoctions of cultural pioneers who deliberately set out to shape the way future generations think and speak
 In every instance what is remarkable is how the unlocking of a word’s biography helps us unlock both the biography of the individual who coined it as well as the age in which he or she lived
 What follows are eight intriguing coinages that have altered the way we think about, see, hear, discover, and exist in the world around us:
Twitter

Social media would certainly be a less cheerful place without Twitter’s chirpy logo: that powder-blue profile of a floating bird forever frozen in mid warble
 But who first had the phonic imagination to fashion an onomatopoetic compromise between the language of feathers and the language of men
 ‘Twitter’ (or ‘twiterith’ as it was initially crafted in the second half of the 14th century), first trilled from the quill of Geoffrey Chaucer in his translation of Consolation of Philosophyby the 6th Century philosopher Boethius
 Predating both ‘chirp’ and ‘warble’ by a century, ‘twitter’ is one of over 2,200 words for which the Medieval poet is credited with having inked an inaugural usage
 That it’s the same author who wrote the poem The Parlement of Foules seems entirely appropriate
Serendipity
(Credit: Tom McShane)
Before 1754, if someone had wanted to express ‘the fortuitous discovery of something by chance’, he or she would have had to dip his or her nib more than a few times to eke out the full slog of such a cumbersome sentiment
 Then presto, on Tuesday 28 January, the English writer Horace Walpole, while composing a letter, gifted to the world that rather peppy prance of syllables: ‘serendipity’
 Walpole said he based his lyrical invention on a Persian fairy tale, The Three Princes of Serendip, whose protagonists, he insisted, “were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity”
 That Walpole misremembered the actual gist of the tale (in fact the princes fail to find what they were looking for despite painstaking attempts) hardly matters; ‘serendipity’ is here to stay – a happy accident indeed
 It’s not Walpole’s only quirky coinage
 ‘Betweenity’, a word far more charming than its better-known synonym, ‘intermediateness’, deserves the same affection that its sibiling ‘serendipity’ has enjoyed
Panorama
(Credit: Tom McShane)
Some words seem to vibrate with the very spirit of the meaning they denote
 “Panorama” is one of these; its very rhythm seems in harmony with the wide, mountain-top vistas, boundless horizons, and unblinkered breadth of vision for which it stands
 That the word (which literally means ‘all-seeing’) should have entered the world’s lexicon around 1789, a year synonymous with the collapse of that notorious cultural enclosure, Paris’s prison-fortress the Bastille, seems entirely appropriate to panorama’s emancipating vibe
 How ironic, then, to discover that the word was initially attached to an entirely confined experience: a cylindrical painting that imprisons its audience – an indoor visual contraption devised by the Irish artist Robert Barker
Visualise
(Credit: Tom McShane)
It’s hard to believe that no one had ever ‘visualised’ anything before 1817, but that’s the year the Romantic poet and critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge coined the word in his philosophical confession Biographia Literaria (a full century before the word ‘envision’ was minted)
 In retrospect it seems fitting that a writer whose mind’s eye was haunted by such phantasmic visions as the spectral ship in his poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and by the “flashing eyes” and “floating hair” that unsettle the ending of his prophetic lyric Kubla Khan, should be the one to give a name to the seeing of the unseeable
 Tortured throughout his life by both material and immaterial substances alike, Coleridge is unsurprisingly responsible for introducing into English other words for describing the darker aspects of experience, such as ‘psychosomatic’ and ‘pessimism’
Intellectualise
(Credit: Tom McShane)
Coleridge is frequently given credit too for devising a related verb: to ‘intellectualise’, meaning to transform a physical object into a property of the mind
 While he certainly deserves credit for coining a term that suggests the very opposite – the underused ‘thingify’ (which means to turn a thought into an object) – in fact ‘intellectualise’ probably belongs to an obscure contemporary and inspiration of the Romantic poet: a mysterious 18th-Century traveller known by the curious nickname ‘Walking Stewart’ for his celebrated feat of having wandered over a greater portion of the known world than anyone before him
 In his decades of rambling over India, Africa and Europe, Stewart developed an eccentric philosophy that centred on the notion that mind and body were in constant flux between a world that is ceaselessly intellectualised and a spirit that is endlessly thingified
Bureaucracy
(Credit: Tom McShane)
The hobo narrator of Harry McClintock’s 1928 song Big Rock Candy Mountain dreams of reaching a carefree paradise where “they hung the jerk who invented work”
 While history may not remember the name of that particular “jerk”, we do know who the identity of the French economist who invented a word for something almost as tiresome”: ‘bureaucracy’
 In 1818, Jean Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay tethered the French word for desk (bureau) to the Greek suffix that means ‘the power of’ (-cracy) and gave a name to the red tape that was beginning to strangle society
 Having coined a word for the governmental processes that impose tedious rules on individual behaviour, Gournay might seem the last person we’d expect to give birth to a term that means “let people do as they think best”: laissez-faire
Photograph
(Credit: Tom McShane)
Strange to think that some of the most seemingly stable names we attach to the objects around us were embraced only gradually and by a process of elimination
 The English astronomer and inventor Sir John Herschel’s proposal of the word ‘photograph’ in 1839 had to see off rival coinages before becoming fixed permanently in the world’s vocabulary
 Had history taken another path, your gran might be admonishing you for not sending enough ‘sun-prints’ or ‘photogenes’
 One competitor, heliograph, which predated ‘photograph’ by a generation, gave Herschel’s suggestion a serious run for its money
Muggle

Men, needless to say, are not, as a gender, uniquely skilled at coining compelling words, however uncelebrated female neologists have been
 With their contributions to culture frequently marginalised, is there any wonder that we find that the Oxford English Dictionary attributes to female writers the first usage of such words as ‘outsider’ (to Jane Austen in 1800) and ‘angst’ (imported from German by George Eliot in 1849)
 In our own age, it has once again fallen to a female novelist to define who is endowed with the powers of the initiated and those left wanting of wizardry ways
 J K Rowling’s coining of ‘muggle’ in her 1997 book Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone to describe mortals bereft of supernatural skill, reminds of the perennial magic of words – those who have it and those who don’t
Dry January is almost over, and temporary teetotallers everywhere will soon be back on the booze
 That word ‘booze’ tends to conjure up a certain amount of slurring, with perhaps a swig of decadence thrown in
 It also sounds distinctly modern
 It is, in fact, over five centuries old, having slipped into English from the Dutch word buizen, to drink to excess
 It gets an early mention in the Elizabethan play Jack Drum’s Entertainmentand the pithy statement ‘You must needs bouze’ - a sentiment with which few of January’s hydropots (one term for water-drinkers) would disagree
Medieval 
The English word ‘booze’ is over 500 years old, coming from the Dutch word buizen (Credit: Alamy Stock Photo)
‘Booze’ was once a popular term in the slang or ‘cant’ of the criminal underworld, which may explain its rebellious overtones today
 But whether formally or informally, when it comes to alcohol, English has been hard at work for centuries
  ‘Alcohol’ itself is 800 years old, taken from the Spanish Arabic al-kuḥul which meant ‘the kohl’, linking it with the same black eye cosmetic you’ll find on any modern make-up counter
 The term was originally applied to powders or essences obtained by alchemists through the process of distillation
 This included both unguents for the face as well as liquid spirits of the intoxicating kind
The only subjects that fill the pages of English slang more are money and sex
The heady result has been with us ever since
 Purveyors of the strong stuff have invited hundreds of epithets over a millennium or more
 Drinkers of the past would happily visit ‘the Lushington crib’, ‘shicker shop’, or ‘fuddle-caps hall’ (ie the local pub) to sample the offerings of the landlord - aka the jolly ‘knight of the spigot’
Drinker 
‘Booze’ was once a popular term from the slang or ‘cant’ of the criminal underworld (Credit: Mary Evans Picture Library / Alamy Stock Photo)
The concoctions those knights dispensed fill an even richer lexicon, veering from the euphemistic ‘tiger’s milk’ to the blatant invitation of ‘strip-me-naked’
 Add those to the 3,000 words English currently holds for the state of being drunk (including ‘ramsquaddled’, ‘obfusticated’, ‘tight as a tick’, and the curious ‘been too free with Sir Richard’) and you’ll find that the only subjects that fill the pages of English slang more are money and sex
Such a lush lexicon makes it all the harder to forsake alcohol for a whole month
 Those who’ve made it, however, can console themselves with the fact that they have enjoyed weeks without the unpleasantness of feeling ‘crapulent’, ‘cropsick’, or ‘wamble-cropped’: three beautifully expressive words for the dreaded hangover
In days gone by, drinkers opted for extreme cure-alls for the morning after the night before, from the ashes of a crab to the drinking of vinegar, although the wealthier might have preferred dropping an amethyst into their glass before imbibing
 ‘Amethyst’ itself came to the language from the Ancient Greek amethustos, which means ‘not drunken’, because the stone was once believed to hold magical properties that prevented intoxication
Gin Lane 
Some of the 3,000 words that English has for being drunk include ramsquaddled and obfusticated (Credit: Alamy Stock Photo)
Meanwhile, the idea of having a ‘hair of the dog (that bit you)’ was once entirely literal
 In the Middle Ages, anyone bitten by a stray dog would run after the offending animal in an attempt to pluck out one of its hairs: a poultice with that hair was believed to greatly ease the post-drinking blues (what in German they call a Katzenjammer, in which the drinker’s moans are compared to the wailing of a very miserable cat)
 It is probably entirely appropriate that the word ‘poison’ is rooted in the Latin potare, to drink
‘Drunk as a thrush’
Those on the wagon can afford a smug smile over shenanigans like these
 The wagon in question originally carried water around small town America during the temperance movement, when citizens were urged to embrace ‘tee-totallism’, in which the ‘tee’ was there simply to give emphasis to the first letter of Total
Beerhouse 
The post-drinking blues is called Katzenjammer in German, comparing the person’s hungover moans to a mournful cat (Credit: Mary Evans Picture Library / Alamy Stock Photo)
The idea soon crossed to Britain, where abstinence battled with the thrill of being ‘drunk as a lord’, an expression from the 17th Century that’s curiously linked to the swear-word ‘bloody’
 The expletive is thought to have begun with the ‘bloods’ or aristocratic rowdies of the same period, when to be ‘bloody drunk’ was to be as ‘drunk as a blood’ – in other words, as sloshed as a posh hooligan
 There was, it seems, nothing these bloods liked more than painting the town red, another phrase in the drinking arsenal that the town of Melton Mowbray near Leicester in the East Midlands of England has claimed for its own, thanks to a night when the Marquis of Waterford and a group of friends ran riot with pots of scarlet paint
The adjective ‘bridal’ began as ‘bride-ale’, and was used of a wedding feast that featured plenty of the strong stuff
For all that partakers in dry January have avoided such results of befuddlement directly, it would be hard to do so with their more metaphorical tongues, for drinking is behind a surprising number of words that have since hidden their tipsy history
 The adjective ‘bridal’ began as ‘bride-ale’, and was used of a wedding feast that featured plenty of the strong stuff
 ‘Small beer’, on the other hand, was a heavily watered-down version of the original, enjoyed by both children and adults when drinking water could prove a lot more perilous than ale
While we like nothing better than lampooning politicians on social media these days, that word too has its roots in guzzling
 ‘Lampons
’, for the French, meant ‘let us drink
’, and was an exhortation to merry revellers to pick up their glasses and sing a song or two
 As those songs tended to be mocking and satirical, so our modern sense of ridicule crept in
  Lampooning and carousing went together – appropriately enough given that ‘carouse’ is from the German gar aus trinken, meaning ‘drink to the bottom of the glass’
Temperance poster

There’s an even more surprising word to add to this list
 We may be ‘pissed as a newt’ these days, but for the Romans the image of choice would be ‘drunk as a thrush’, an allusion it seems to the bird’s merry tottering around vineyards after feasting on fermented grapes
 Bizarrely, our English word ‘sturdy’ may go back to the Latin turdus, thrush
 Anyone described as ‘sturdy’ in the 1200s was wilfully reckless and possibly as immovable as a sozzled bird
Birds do it, newts do it, even educated lords do it: the pull of getting groggy seems hard to resist
 Especially if you’re a sailor, whose associations with rum are legendary
  Fittingly, ‘groggy’ itself was born on the high seas thanks to the English naval officer Admiral Edward Vernon, nicknamed Old Grog on account of his thick coat made of coarse grogram cloth
 It was Vernon who gave the unhappy order that his sailors’ rations of rum should be diluted with water
  He surely would not, then, have approved of two expressions that emerged in the sailors’ slang of his day
An Admiral of the Narrow Seas is defined in Francis Grose’s 1785 Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongueas “one who from drunkenness vomits into the lap of the person sitting opposite him”
 (Worse still, a Vice-Admiral of those same seas is ‘a drunken man that pisses under the table into his companion’s shoes’
)  Not for nothing, perhaps, were those who liked to throw back their mug of beer and drink its contents with relish known as ‘tosspots’ from the start
Tosspot or hydropot, English has lessons for us all
 And if a pint of foaming ale or glass of tantalizing red is beckoning from the hands of February, cheers
 And don’t forget your amethyst
Disguised in a wig and sunglasses, the artist Jo Brocklehurst went undercover to draw some of the larger-than-life figures of London’s nightlife at fetish clubs and punk gigs
 But her extraordinary body of work – including portraits of everyone from Boy George to Billy Idol – has remained largely unknown
An exhibition of her work created from the 1960s up to her death in 2006, called Nobodies and Somebodies, may change that
 The show reveals an unparalleled window into the subversive underbelly of punk, as well as the first connective sparks between this local subculture and the international fashion world
“She was a true artist, the real deal, drawing every day of her life,” says Isabelle Bricknall, Brocklehurst’s close friend and co-curator of the exhibition
 “The objective was never money
 The art establishment at that time wouldn’t have touched punks with a ten-foot bargepole, but she saw something there
 She was ahead of her time

 Jo Brocklehurst captured her subjects in unguarded moments

A child prodigy, Brocklehurst was offered a scholarship to study at renowned Saint Martin’s School of Art at the tender age of 14
 She graduated four years later, by which time the staid traditions of fashion illustration, mainly tasteful renditions of Parisian haute couture, were no longer exciting
 Brocklehurst took her rigorous academic training and turned her attention to London’s seedy underworld, immersing herself in the nascevnt punk scene of the late 1960s and the fetish clubs where people were exploring alternative sexualities
Brocklehurst sported a wig and sunglasses, moving around stealthily to capture her subjects at their most unguarded moments
Brocklehurst frequented these overlooked corners of the city in disguise and with her sketchbook in hand, moving around stealthily to capture her subjects at their most unguarded moments
Her personal life was equally secretive
 Brocklehurst always refused to reveal her exact age, but it has been accepted she was born at some point in the 1930s, the illegitimate child of an affair between a senior political figure from Sri Lanka and an English mother
 She was so guarded about her background that many of her friends did not even realise her dual heritage

Bright lights, big cities
She also had an uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time
 A tireless traveller, Brocklehurst spent extended periods in Berlin and New York, crossing paths with everyone from Siouxsie Sioux and Billy Idol to Andy Warhol and Keith Haring
 She even exhibited in the headline-grabbing 1980 exhibition at London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts, Women’s Images of Men, followed by successful gallery shows in the city in 1981 and 1982
 Whether immersed in the anti-establishment spirit of the 1960s, hanging around with the 1970s Pop artists in New York, a stalwart of the Blitz club kids scene in 1980s Soho, she was always observing, always recording – and always honing her craft
She became one of fashion’s best-kept secrets – Isabelle Bricknall
“Despite all that, she was never seduced by fame,” Bricknall says
 “Everyone knew who she was, and would try and jump in front of her and get their picture drawn in the clubs
 Even with the following generations, people like Alexander McQueen and John Galliano, who were around when Jo was a septuagenarian
 She became one of fashion’s best-kept secrets
 If you were really hip and happening, Jo would draw you
 The irony is that she never knew who the people were; she had no interest in celebrity
 It was usually up to me to identify who she’d drawn on one of her nights out
”
Brocklehurst is known for using wiry, fluid lines, contorted poses and theatrical gestures

Brocklehurst’s style is often linked to that of Egon Schiele: wiry, fluid lines used to describe the topography of the human form, contorted poses and theatrical gestures and luminous eyes that arrest the viewer with a cold and magisterial gaze
 But she arguably fits better into the lineage of 20th-Century documentary artists who placed their subjects first and their egos second
 Like Diane Arbus or Mary Ellen Mark, Brocklehurst shows an interest in those who lived their lives at the fringes of society, granting them the dignity they may never have been afforded elsewhere
Sunglasses at night
“She loved Leonora Carrington and Frida Kahlo, for example, because they were women of convinction
 They stepped outside the norms of their societies,” says Bricknall
 “She was aware of the importance of her gender in being a documentary artist, because there’s a certain trust afforded to women that means they can go places men can’t
 Even though she could be quite an intimidating presence – fabulous looking and a lady of mystery – people were drawn to her like a magnet
”
As records of the culture in which they were produced, the drawings offer a refreshingly personal antidote to the black-and-white photography of punk’s genesis you might find elsewhere
 Brocklehurst saw her subjects in pulsing, kaleidoscopic colour: the heat flushing their cheeks, thick veins winding up their forearms, lurid pink flesh that seems to throb
 It’s a visceral experience witnessing them up close, dragging the viewer into the din and heat of their underground world
 By isolating her subjects from the chaotic context of a club or a drag bar, she grants them a seductive subjectivity
 We're left to fill in the gaps, to construct our own debauched narratives for each of these weird and wonderful characters
“She saw her art as a sacred act – and if I say that to some people, their shutters come down, because it's not cool to think about it like that – but Jo was very spiritual
 She was drawing with sunglasses on, and I’d see her pick up her pencils or brushes and start making these initial marks in vibrant colours
 I asked her how she did that, and she explained that she saw auras around people
 On the fetish scene, she saw people as either angelic or demonic, and she'd represent that
”
Brocklehurst might come across like a classic British eccentric, but her prodigious abilities and relentless curiosity speak otherwise
 Her work isn’t just impressive for its refusal to patronise its subjects, but also for its playfulness and wit

A final series is displayed at the end of the exhibition, inspired by Alice in Wonderland – supposedly from after Brocklehurst returned from a stint in New York and felt compelled to reacquaint herself with a sense of Englishness
 Cream teas and summer fetes, however, this is not
 Brocklehurst offers a radical reimagining of the characters, the Queen of Hearts resplendent in an armour-like fetish gown
 At a time when the transgressive edges of London's nightlife are gradually eroding, let's hope Brocklehurst’s drawings, and the thrilling culture that went with it, don’t end up as relics of a bygone Britain
This story is a part of BBC Britain – a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time

A movie in which Casey Affleck spends most of his time covered by a bedsheet sounds like a missing segment from The Five Obstructions, and there are times, especially in its early stages, when David Lowery’s A Ghost Story seems like a result of a particularly outlandish dare
 Perhaps a quarter of the way into its 87-minute running time, Affleck’s character, never named on screen and identified in the credits only as C, turns up dead in the wreckage of a car crash, and for the rest of the movie, barring the occasional flashback, he’s covered in a white sheet with cut-out eyeholes, haunting his bereaved widow and the house they once lived in
You will find it hard to wave off the movie’s naked depiction of unresolved grief
Lowery, who squeezed in A Ghost Story’s 19-day shoot after wrapping the Disney fable Pete’s Dragon and before his next studio movie, The Old Man and the Gun, is practically daring his audience as well: daring them not to laugh at the sight of an A-list actor dressed like a trick-or-treating child, to bite down hard on the tendency to wave off the movie’s naked depiction of unresolved grief
And it does take a while for the movie to find its groove (or, perhaps, for the viewer to find it): the initial scenes in which Affleck and Mara, identified only as M, bicker about whether to abandon their rural house for an apartment in the city feel stilted and shapeless, more like acting exercises than part of a completed film
 The exception is one striking long take in which, prompted by the mysterious vibration of a piano’s strings in the middle of the night, they cuddle up to each other in bed, slowly kissing each other before they fall back to sleep
It turns out the movie doesn’t need to convincingly establish their relationship for us to feel their loss
 Seen only from the perspective of the ghost who now invisibly haunts their home, Mara’s largely silent sorrow is moving beyond words
 She turns a scene – filmed largely in an unbroken take – in which her character grief-eats the better part of an entire pie left by a well-wishing friend into a miniature symphony of hunger and loss, capped by a quick sprint to the nearest toilet
Memento mori
After that, the movie begins to sprint through time
 The house is vacated and reoccupied as Affleck watches from behind his blackened eyeholes
 (There is another actor credited as Ghost Phase 2 but it’s genuinely him under there at least some of the time
) Although he apparently possesses the ability to move objects in classic poltergeist style, he’s a passive witness for much of the time, a blank slate on which we can project our own experience of loss or those suggested by extensive use of the Kuleshov effect, a technique by which neutral expressions are given meaning through editing
It’s a movie that frequently gives you a choice whether to laugh or cry
Although the change the house goes through means that at some point we must be years into the future, Lowery and co adopt a timeless look
 Although the movie was shot digitally, Andrew Droz Palermo’s cinematography adopts the nearly square format of 16mm film, right down to the rounded corners
 It’s as if we’re far in the future, watching an artefact pulled from the wreckage of some long-gone civilization, finding our way into its story through the unspoken language of cinema without needing to grasp the particulars of a given situation
The last film Lowery brought to Sundance was Ain’t Them Bodies Saints, a gorgeous but derivative crime thriller that wore its Terrence Malick affectations on its checkered sleeves
 A Ghost Story has touches of Malick as well, especially early on, when shots of Affleck and Mara’s domestic life are intercut with blazing starfields and the image of splintered, rainbow-coloured light undulating in the darkness
 But there’s an underlying quality of deadpan humour to go along with the movie’s cosmic viewpoint, rather than the orchestral lunges of Malick’s recent movies
 It’s a movie that frequently gives you the choice to laugh or cry, or to stay poised between the two
 A Ghost Story is a deliberate abstraction, and as such, it’s easy to appreciate its conceptual audacity and its visual beauty while still feeling remote from its overt sentimentality
 But the further it drifts from its initial setup, the more moving it becomes
 It’s pushing toward something simple and pure, almost elemental in the way that spaces are haunted by the memories they contain, and how we may leave those spaces but they never leave us
 (Some of the transitions recall the heartbreaking final shots of Robert Altman’s Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean
) We start out watching a ghost, and by the end, we become ghosts ourselves
A sensual maximalist who prefers the golden light of the Mediterranean to the snowy mountains of Utah, Luca Guadagnino is something of an odd one out at the Sundance Film Festival
 So it was especially intriguing that he chose to premiere Call Me By Your Name, a coming-of-age story set in northern Italy here, rather than in the more glamorous and sunnier surroundings of Venice or Cannes
It is a notch above even Sundance’s buzziest entries
It turns out to be a wise decision: Call Me By Your Namestands apart at this year’s festival not just for its European origins or for being the work of a mature film-maker rather than an emerging one, but also in terms of its artistic accomplishment, which is a notch above even Sundance’s buzziest entries
That’s not to say Call Me By Your Name is without its discoveries: in the central role of Elio, Timothée Chalamet emerges as a dazzling new talent
 At 20, the actor, best known for playing Finn Walden on the US TV thriller Homeland, shifts from confidence to vulnerability with a veteran’s ease, essential to the role of a sexually forthright young man who finds his desires taking him into uncharted territory
 He also plays the piano beautifully – including, at one point, reinterpreting Bach in the manner of Liszt, layering romantic style on top of baroque structure in a tidy summary of the film itself
 (There’s a similar tension in the score, which balances furious minimalist compositions with lush new songs by Sufjan Stevens
)
For nearly half its length, Call Me By Your Name feels like a mood that has yet to develop into a movie, but that mirrors the carefree timelessness of summertime in Italy for 17-year-old Elio, the son of an American professor (Michael Stuhlbarg) who specialises in Greco-Roman sculpture and a polylingual mother (Amira Casar) who can translate German literature on the fly
 The arrival of Oliver (Armie Hammer), his father’s summer research assistant, gives Oliver’s world a shake, but at first, the tremors are barely noticeable: they’re pursued so avidly by the women of the rustic Lombardy town that their attraction to each other passes almost unremarked, a matter of discreet gestures and lingering glances that Guadagnino frames in leisurely medium shots rather than using the camera to underline them
A grand passion
Although Call Me By Your Name is vague about its location, which is identified only as “somewhere in northern Italy”, it’s specific about taking place in 1983, which in addition to allowing the Psychedelic Furs’ Love My Way to play a key role in the plot also places it at the beginning of the Aids era, although the feeling is more like the last gasp of the carefree years before
 The love that dare not speak its name is mentioned only in passing, and usually with reference to other characters: when Elio chuckles at a flamboyant male couple who’ve come over for dinner, his father scolds him and asks, “Is it because they’re gay, or because they’re ridiculous
”
The movie, which was adapted from André Aciman’s novel by Guadagnino, Walter Fasano and James Ivory, has some of the dreamy languorousness of Merchant-Ivory’s Maurice; it seems to take place in a world where the characters are at once so free and so blinkered that Oliver and Elio’s desire can develop almost unnoticed in plain sight, and Elio’s mother can praise their “special friendship” without apparently sensing anything amiss
There are few great films without great endings, and Call Me By Your Name has one
At times, the development of Oliver and Elio’s relationship is so subtle as to be almost obscure: one extraordinary long take staged around a World War One monument in the town square climaxes with the elliptical question, “Are you talking about what I think you’re talking about
” But once their romance finally becomes physical, they can put those gestures and glances into words, effectively going back and decoding key scenes from the movie’s first half (which is not to say that the scene in which Oliver develops a pressing concern with the sore muscles in a shirtless Elio’s shoulder is especially encoded to begin with)
But teenage Elio’s emotional resources lag somewhat behind his physical confidence
 This is probably not the first time he’s desired a man, but it may be the first time it’s been able to develop into something more, and Chalamet lets us see both Elio’s emotions and the times when they grow almost too large for his body to hold
There are few great films without great endings, and Call Me By Your Name has one in the form of a monologue by Michael Stuhlbarg – capping off one of his finest performances – that puts a frame around the movie’s painting and opens up avenues we may not have thought to explore
 Guadagnino seems to have designed it to expand in the mind after the fact, once the more pressing emotions conjured by its copious shots of attractive bodies have subsided
It’s hard to think of many movies that have so successfully appealed to both the intellectual and the erotic since the heydays of Patrice Chéreau and André Téchiné
 Acquired by Sony Pictures Classics before the festival, Call Me By Your Name is reportedly being mulled for a late summer release, although its ecstatic reception may push it into the autumn awards-season fray
 But whenever it ends up being released, it will be worth waiting for
Is it possible for a movie to be too timely
 With the earth’s temperature hitting a record high for the third year in a row, a sequel to Al Gore’s Oscar-winning climate change documentary An Inconvenient Truth couldn’t be more relevant
 But watching it open the Sundance Film Festial the night before Donald Trump’s inauguration, it was difficult to come away with the message Gore relayed to the crowd from the stage after the lights came up: “We are going to win this
”
Sundance has a strong midnight movies section, but this is more terrifying than The Babadook
An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk, offers glimpses of the Keynote presentation made famous by its Oscar-winning predecessor, updated with freshly alarming statistics and footage from the intervening decade
 One graph, showing the proportion of days per year in five different temperature categories, starts out as a comforting bell curve, with an even distribution of cooler- and hotter-than-average days on either side
 But as Gore progresses through the years, the central hump lurches toward the hot end of the scale like a drunken porcupine
 Sundance has a strong midnight movies section, but that slouching form is more terrifying than the Babadook
 (There are feel-good slides, too, showing the growth of renewable energy sources in scattered spots around the world, but they don’t hit with the same force
)
Gore has always approached the fight for climate change as a political actor, calculating the precise dosages of hope and despair to shock his audience’s conscience without short-circuiting their minds
 But there are people whom no jolt can move, including the man who will be president of the US by the time this review is published, and who turns up periodically in An Inconvenient Sequel as a televised image or a disembodied voice suggesting that Obama’s focus on climate change is a dereliction of his duty, that he should “get back to work” and “solve the Isis problem
”
Heated argument
Although it has fierce competition, climate policy may be the best illustration of how poisonously partisan US political culture has become
 Gore tells the story of Dscovr, a satellite developed during Bill Clinton’s presidency that would have provided detailed images showing precisely how the earth’s climate was shifting
 When George W Bush took over the White House, the project was scrapped, until the energy companies who were counting on the satellite’s sensors to help them guard against the damages caused by solar storms protested
 The Bush administration then agreed to launch Dscovr, but only after all the devices pertaining to measuring earth’s climate had been stripped away
 And then, after all that, they failed to launch it at all
Gore, this sequel shows us, has been building an army, training thousands of climate advocates to deliver his presentation all over the world
 But while ordinary people can encourage their leaders to act, only those leaders can make the kinds of widespread changes necessary
 So after following Gore around the world, where he surveys melting ice sheets and slogs through the flooded streets of Miami, the movie ends up at the 2015 climate conference in Paris
 The mood in the weeks beforehand is cautiously optimistic, until it’s shattered by the terrorist attacks that left 130 dead
  But in the wake of that tragedy, the nations of the world came together – with a little help from Al Gore – and signed a historic agreement
 It’s a heartwarming story of humanity’s disparate factions coming together in the wake of something terrible and rising above it
Gore calmly lectures audiences in a voice that drifts between reassuring and soporific
In much of An Inconvenient Sequel, Gore is in his familiar professorial mode, calmly lecturing audiences in a voice that drifts between reassuring and soporific
 But on a few occasions, his emotions get the better of him, and that voice develops an exasperated rasp
 Gore apologizes for getting carried away, but his anger, rare as it is, is the most galvanising thing in the movie, suggesting that, on some level, Gore knows there are times when you have to stop trying to persuade everyone and simply fight those you feel are on the wrong side of history
 At a rally, Gore quotes Martin Luther King Jr’s famous statement that “the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice
” In truth, though, that arc only bends if we bend it
An Inconvenient Sequel comes close to sanctifying Gore; while he says he sometimes views the lack of global progress on climate change as “a personal failure,” the film never encourages us to agree with him
 The most important figure in the movie isn’t Al Gore, but the mayor of Georgetown, Texas, a midsized town that is in the process of shifting all of its energy to renewable source
 The mayor is a self-proclaimed conservative Republican, the elected leader of “the reddest city in the reddest county” in the state
 He frames the shift as a simple matter of dollars and cents, but it’s also clear that he believes a person should leave the earth in better shape than they found it – an idea that ought to be simple enough to transcend the differences between political parties
 A small town in Texas isn’t where you’d expect to find hope for the future of the planet, but with a storm this menacing, any port will do
The long, long-awaited sequel to Trainspotting is all about four fortysomethings realising that they aren’t as young as they used to be, so it’s appropriate that the film itself should feel distinctly middle-aged compared to its youthful predecessor
 T2 Trainspotting, to use its perplexing title, is slower and creakier than Trainspotting
 It’s not as good-looking, it’s more conventional, and it’s prone to getting maudlin about times gone by
 Depending on how forgiving you are – and how old you are – you’ll either be impressed that it has incorporated the theme of ageing into its milder tone and gentler pacing, or you’ll be disappointed that it isn’t the white-knuckle rollercoaster ride that Trainspotting was
To be fair, not many films are
 Adapted from Irvine Welsh’s cult novel about a group of heroin-addicted Edinburgh low-lifes, 1996’s stylishly scabrous tragicomedy bombarded the viewer with grotesque characters and explosive anecdotes, using captions, voiceover, and supremely well-chosen songs – Iggy Pop’s Lust for Life, Lou Reed’s Perfect Day, Underworld’s Born Slippy – to jam in yet more information
 If you had left the cinema after the opening 10 minutes, you still would have got your money’s worth
The sequel is a mellower affair
 Even though it has the same director (Danny Boyle) and screenwriter (John Hodge), it cuts back on the narration and the captions, and it takes quite a while to fill us in on where the characters are and what they’ve been up to
 Amazingly, they are all still alive
 Renton (Ewan McGregor) has been living drug-free in Amsterdam for the past 20 years, but is returning to Edinburgh following his mother’s death
 The hapless Spud (Ewen Bremner) has been trying and failing to stay away from heroin, losing touch with a wife and son in the process
 Begbie (Robert Carlyle) has been in prison, where his waistline, his moustache and his violent streak have all expanded
 And Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) has been snorting cocaine, running his aunt’s grotty pub, and blackmailing the clients of a Bulgarian prostitute (Anjela Nedyalkova)
A final hit
The last time these four men were in the same room was when Renton was sneaking out of it with a hold-all full of stolen cash, so he isn’t exactly welcomed back to Scotland with open arms
 Sick Boy asks him to help turn the pub into a brothel, purely so that he can betray Renton further down the line
 Begbie, meanwhile, is planning a less subtle revenge involving a Stanley knife and a sledgehammer
Quite a few sequences would be more at home in a rambling, direct-to-video crime caper
The misadventures that follow have plenty of familiar Trainspotting elements: snapped pool cues and grimy nightclubs, virtuoso swearing and sudden violence, freeze frames and special effects
 Balancing social realism and cartoonish excess, it’s an enjoyably dark and ribald farce with more gusto than most British films (Doyle’s included)
 But the fact is that every ingredient in T2 is inferior to its equivalent in T1: the cinematography is dingier, the editing isn’t as frenetic, the music isn’t as catchy, and the performances aren’t as sharp (although Miller, an English actor, does an even better Scottish accent this time around)
 Only one sequence – in which Renton and Sick Boy rob a Protestant social club and then celebrate by bonding over their love of George Best – has the outrageousness and hectic energy of the first film
 And quite a few sequences would be more at home in a rambling, direct-to-video crime caper
 I mean
 Viagra jokes in 2017
 Really
If it’s difficult to watch T2 without remembering how much better Trainspotting was, the film’s saving grace is its own willingness to comment on this decline
 Like the various Hollywood franchise reboots that came out in 2015 – Creed, Jurassic World, The Force Awakens – it stirs up fond memories of a beloved masterpiece, and it prompts us to think about all the years that have passed since that masterpiece was released
 As Renton and the others recall their younger, more hedonistic selves, Boyle cleverly splices in clips from the 1996 film, as well as sending the characters off on sentimental journeys to its most memorable locations
 His masterstroke is to put in footage of the characters as children, kicking around a football in the primary-school playground, thus establishing that their relationship goes back a lot farther than their junkie days
 If one of them had started singing Auld Lang Syne, it wouldn’t have seemed out of place
Sometimes, the film’s addiction to nostalgia spirals out of control
 When Renton updates his “Choose life” monologue, for instance, it’s one fix too many
 But, in general, the meanderings down memory lane are genuinely moving: Trainspotting and T2 deserve to sit next to Richard Linklater’s Before trilogy and Truffaut’s Adventures of Antoine Doinel in a file marked Bittersweet Chronicles of How We Grow Up and Grow Old
 One curious omission is any reference to the “unifying theory of life” that Sick Boy advanced in the original Trainspotting: “At one point you’ve got it, and then you lose it
 Then it’s gone forever
” Boyle and his cohorts had it, and then they lost some of it, but it’s touching that they are so aware of that loss
If a dog lives seven years for every one we do, how many spider-months are there in a monkey-summer
 How many stickleback-seconds does it take to make a giraffe-jiffy
 And while we’re at it, who establishes these conversion rates for the units we use to measure out our experience of the world
 Who decides how we map one pace of reality onto another
Such curious questions about quantifying life were brought to mind this week with the emergence of photos and videos from locations as far flung as Queens, New York, and Limpopo, South Africa
 The clash between the rhythms and perspectives of humans and those of animals that is captured in these images is fascinating and recalls a famous conundrum posed by the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne: “When I play with my cat, who knows if I am not a pastime to her more than she is to me
”
Police officers patrolling the New York City borough of Queens on Tuesday hardly needed echoes of Renaissance literature to appreciate such a swivel in perspective after receiving reports that a menace was on the loose, threatening the safety of the streets
 Accustomed to corralling evasive suspects and getting inside the heads of criminals, the officers responding to the incident were forced to adopt a different mindset altogether after discovering that the rascal in question was a rambunctious cow that had managed to escape from a nearby slaughterhouse

It didn’t take long before social media was atwitter with local bovine spotters commenting on the two-hour chase
 Running simultaneously with that story was one preoccupied with a video shot in rear-view of a slo-mo chase of tourists by a persistent, if lumbering, elephant in South Africa’s Kruger National Park, which also emerged on Tuesday
 In both instances, it’s the unexpected collision of life-speeds – man vs beast, engine vs nature – that invigorates our response – a tension that has at least one compelling parallel in the history of art
No artist understood frictions in perspective better than the British Romantic painter JMW Turner
 Renowned for his vast evaporative visions of sweeping land- and seascapes, Turner turned the tables on those who came to see his breathtaking take on escalating industrialisation, Rain, Steam, and Speed – The Great Western Railway, when it was first exhibited in 1844,by inserting a tiny detail with which the rest of his painting must struggle to keep up

JMW Turner’s Rain, Steam, and Speed – The Great Western Railway (1844) includes a detail that many miss: a galloping hare (Credit: Wikimedia)
Transfixed by the ungainly advance of a locomotive whose dense materiality seems to be forever dissolving into the sun-soaked mist around it, a viewer could easily miss the teensy hare darting along the tracks, outdistancing the hulking contraption that clunks behind it
 Like the images from Queens and South Africa, the incongruous creature interjects into Turner’s painting a competing consciousness of time’s elapse – a symbol that slices the speed of life down to the fleeting milliseconds of the hare-and-now
The jangle of car keys, a door slamming, the clatter of plates
 Ordinary, everyday sounds, which foley artist Alyson Dee Moore has to recreate in extraordinary ways
 “You may not know you’re hearing, but you’re hearing them,” she says in a video revealing how she creates the sound effects in films like The Matrix, The Dark Knight and Frozen
Moore has been a foley artist for more than 30 years, painstakingly recreating sound effects that are timed to match what’s happening on the screen
 “You shouldn’t notice it – it should just fit seamlessly
”
The video offers a glimpse inside Moore’s studio, which is “full of junk” – scuffed shoes, piles of plant pots, crutches leaning against the wall and shelves filled with coconut shells
 And there’s an insight into the process of making sounds like space helmets colliding (involving a pine cone) or knuckles cracking (using uncooked lasagne sheets)
 As Moore’s mixer Mary Jo Lang comments, “Foley is a unique kind of sound, because it’s bigger than life but it still sounds like life”
Few symbols in history have signified the raw energies of life itself more potently than the bull
 We grab it by the horns to demonstrate our authority over situations; we wave a red flag in its face to show our fearlessness
 Since prehistory, the bull’s imagined muscles have clenched tight in our subconscious, like a hand grenade of crude virility waiting to blow
As the famous Palaeolithic paintings discovered in caves in southwestern France have revealed, when human beings finally began to draw, they drew the bull
 Studded with stars and stalking the sky, Taurus’s skull, so we imagine, constellates the heavens above us
 When life is booming and the stock market stampedes, it isn’t the ram or bison or woolly mammoth that tramples the doddering bear, but the hulking hustle of the triumphant bull

An image circulating in the media this week, captured in Indonesia during the so-called Pacu Jawi (or bull races, held in honour of each year’s harvest), reveals how robust the connection between harnessing the strength of a bull and projecting one’s own indomitability continues to be
 Conducted in a sodden rice field, the competition requires jockeys to suspend themselves dangerously between the hurtling might of two bulls by clinging to a crude wooden frame – their bodies seem at risk of being split in two at any second as they skim a filthy tumult of mud
The elegant balletics depicted in Bronze Age art of acrobats somersaulting poetically through the air, propelled by the brawny jut of a bull’s neck, suggest that such pastimes as the Pacu Jawi have, since time immemorial, preoccupied human culture
 Indeed a whole history of art could be written tracing a line of imaginative descent from the cave paintings of Lascaux, through statues of Minoan bull-leapers, through Rembrandt’s 1632 depiction of Europa being snatched by Zeus disguised as a bull, to Arshile Gorky’s abstracted Study for a bull in the sun (1942), to Damien Hirst’s elaborate visual pun Cock and Bull (2012) – a formaldehyde-filled vitrine in which the artist has immersed a rooster perched on the back of a bull
More so than any of these notable works, however, is a singular sculpture by Pablo Picasso that captures the curious spirit of this week’s photo
 Like the jockeys who participate in the Pacu Jawi, Picasso saw the bull as a vehicle for advancing his sense of self and asserting his hefty machismo
 “If all the ways I have been along”, Picasso once remarked, “were marked on a map and joined up with a line, it might represent a Minotaur”
 Indeed the half-man-half-bull hybrid became a frequent trope in Picasso’s art – a kind of second self that pops up everywhere in his art
(Credit: Wikimedia)

Five years after painting his masterpiece Guernica (which features a bull’s head that many believe is an interjection of the artist’s self in the work), Picasso began seeing semblances of the bull in the most random objects and situations
 In 1942, while passing by the disassembled parts of a bicycle, Picasso discerned in the adjacency of a seat and handlebars a “found” sculpture which he welded together to create the quasi-readymade Bull’s Head
 Hovering ambiguously between a mundane utilitarian contraption, a bicycle, and an archetypal symbol for fertility (and not just male: the sculpture also resembles a diagram of a uterus and fallopian tubes), Picasso’s sculpture hoists itself perilously between the muscular charge of competing visual meanings
 Placed alongside this week’s photo from the muddy rice fields of the Pacu Jawi, the imaginative flight of Picasso’s sculpture reminds us that, in seeking to understand our place in the universe, it’s art that gives you wings
How the Moonlight composer creates music“With Moonlight, when I first read the screenplay… it just felt like a piece of poetry,” says the composer of the film’s score
 Nicholas Britell was nominated for an Academy Award for his work: in this video, he describes how he collaborated with its director Barry Jenkins
 “We said ‘what if we chopped and screwed the score
’” What seems to be warped moments of sound are actually the chords from an earlier theme
Britell – who also scored The Big Short and composed much of the music in 12 Years a Slave – reveals what he considers to be the most important musical movement of the past 50 years, and how a score enhances action in film
“The most interesting film music is when it’s saying something that isn’t on the picture – sometimes when music enters a scene, it just opens a scene in a certain way,” says Britell
 “Every composer has their internal emotional canvas – you’re taking emotions, and you’re translating them into these frequencies in the air that somehow affect us
”For art dealers, the holy grail is coming across a ‘sleeper’: a painting, usually offered at auction, which has been mislabelled by the experts, and is therefore undervalued – sometimes massively so
Perceptions of the same painting sometimes shift radically, almost overnight
Often, a sleeper will be described as a work ‘after’ an Old Master, suggesting that the artist who painted it was imitating a greater, and more saleable, talent
 Eagle-eyed dealers endlessly scour sales catalogues, hoping to come across a lot that their gut tells them has potential
 When they do, they bid for it at a knock-down price before building a case in its favour by conserving it and carefully investigating any leads about its provenance
 Upgrading a picture is a form of detective work, and once the case has been cracked, the sleeper can reappear on the market as a bona-fide masterpiece – with a price tag to match
We hear about stories like this in the news all the time – and it isn’t only pursuit of profit that generates new discoveries
 Art historians, too, often debate the attribution of paintings, and their arguments can turn a picture from dross into gold
 In other words – and this is the part that, to people outside the art world, can seem like black magic – perceptions of the same painting sometimes shift radically, almost overnight
 One minute, a painting is unloved and overlooked; the next, everyone is cooing over it and calling it sublime

So, how, exactly, does this happen
 To find out, recently I visited the Holburne Museum in Bath, where preparations for a new exhibition, Bruegel: Defining a Dynasty, were taking place
The exhibition, which opens on 11 February, is devoted to the famous dynasty of artists founded by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c 1525-69), aka Peasant Bruegel, the painter of peasant scenes who is considered one of the greatest artists of the 16th Century
Although Bruegel’s original composition is lost, more than 100 versions of it exist
At the heart of the show is a newly attributed oil-on-panel painting, from the museum’s own collection
 Called Wedding Dance in the Open Air, it depicts revellers celebrating a rustic wedding in a forest
 The fascinating story of its rediscovery and conservation offers a case study in how to spot a masterpiece – and persuade others that you are right
The right stuff
For years – since at least the middle of the 20th Century – the painting, which was acquired by the collector Sir William Holburne during the 19th Century, was thought to be by an anonymous copyist or follower of Bruegel’s eldest son, Pieter Brueghel [sic] the Younger (1564/5-1638/9), who was also an artist
Brueghel the Younger – he reinstated the “h” that his father had dropped from the family name – lived in Antwerp
 There he established a workshop that produced affordable replicas of his father’s paintings
 Take Wedding Dance in the Open Air
 Although, in its case, Bruegel the Elder’s original composition is lost, more than 100 versions of it exist around the world – of which no fewer than 31 are attributed to Brueghel the Younger
In 2014, shortly after her appointment as director of the Holburne, Jennifer Scott, a specialist in Dutch and Flemish painting, who had previously worked as a curator at the Royal Collection, visited the museum’s storeroom
In this case, certain things jumped out through that murky surface – Jennifer Scott
Considering an exhibition about the Bruegel dynasty, she asked to see Wedding Dance in the Open Air
 At this point, the painting appeared very dark, because it was semi-obscured by discoloured varnish
 Yet immediately, she recalls, she thought the panel had “potential”
(Credit: Holburne Museum, Bath)
The museum was able to authenticate it by using infrared to show both the underlying drawing and the brushstrokes were consistent with Brueghel (Credit: Holburne Museum, Bath)
“It sounds silly, but it’s instinct,” she tells me
 “You look at something and think either, ‘Ooh, no,’ or, ‘Hang on a second
’ In this case, certain things jumped out through that murky surface
”
One thing that caught Scott’s eye was the successful complexity of the whirling composition: “It looks so good, and makes absolute sense,” she says
 She also believed that, beneath the varnish, the colours would be “really vibrant”
 Moreover, she was excited by the curving tree trunk on the right, because “it’s going around the figures, and that’s something we know Brueghel the Younger does: he puts in the figures and then the trees around them
”
Even for a work of modest size, the process for conserving and analysing a painting can cost up to £15,000
In short, the panel felt ‘right’
 Scott had a hunch that it might be the only extant version in Britain of Wedding Dance in the Open Air not by a copyist or follower but, in fact, by Brueghel the Younger himself
 All she had to do was prove it
Conserving and analysing a painting, though, is expensive: even for a picture of such modest size (37cm x 49cm), the process can cost up to £15,000
 So, before going down this road, Scott sought a second opinion
 She invited the Flemish art specialist Amy Orrock to inspect the panel, and Orrock agreed with Scott
 Feeling emboldened, Scott found a donor to fund the project, and sent the picture to Elizabeth Holford, an accredited painting conservator who has worked with museums for more than four decades
Buried treasure
Early on, the painting was examined using infrared reflectography
 This technique allows art historians to see through the uppermost layers of paint, revealing what lies beneath
 The infrared reflectogram revealed the refinement of Wedding Dance’s underdrawing (the preparatory drawing executed before paint is applied)
 When Scott first saw it, she recalls with a smile, “It was a good day
”
Why
 In part because the execution of the underdrawing was so confident and masterful
 Also, because the underdrawing of the Holburne painting corresponded closely, in various ways, to other underdrawings that have been firmly attributed to Brueghel the Younger
 “Brueghel the Younger is known for his complete underdrawings, which we found here,” explains Holford
(Credit: Holburne Museum, Bath)
After the layer of varnish had been removed along with the shoddy bits of paint that had been added later, part of the wood paneling was exposed (Credit: Holburne Museum, Bath)
She passes me a head lens, so I can take a closer look, before pointing to several lines marking drapery folds in the dancers’ clothes
 “Do you see how they end in little hooks
” she asks
 “That’s typical
”
Filling in the bare spots with removable watercolour took six months
Moreover, Holford continues, the underdrawing is remarkably like the painting on top – which is another good sign: “It shows that the hand of the drawing is the same as the hand of the painting,” she explains
 “It’s not just one thing by one person and then somebody else completing it
 There is unity
” “Because the underdrawing is typical of Brueghel the Younger,” Scott adds, “and because the painting on top conforms to his style, that indicates that the painting is also by him
”
Scott and Orrock’s hypothesis is that Brueghel the Younger had, in his workshop, a painting or drawing by his father of the original composition of Wedding Dance in the Open Air, which he used as the basis for a working drawing or ‘cartoon’
 He then used this cartoon repeatedly to transfer the design onto different panels that were primed for painting
Case closed, you might think – except that picture conservation is a painstaking business, and there was still a tremendous amount of work to be done to reveal its true appearance
Peeling away the layers
The painting had to be X-rayed to survey how badly it was damaged
 Then Holford cleaned its surface with saliva (“It’s full of enzymes and surprisingly efficient,” she says)
 After that she used isopropyl alcohol to remove the uppermost layer of varnish, which was, she says, up to 100 years old (the chemistry is such that this runs little risk of damaging the painting)
 Next, underlying, older varnish was taken off with acetone, which also gently removed several clumsy ‘retouchings’ by earlier conservators
Imagine wearing sunglasses at the Sistine Chapel, and then they were removed – Jennifer Scott
Eventually, after around three weeks’ work, like an archaeologist digging down through stratified layers of sediment, she had revealed the painting in its original state: the 17th Century brushwork of Brueghel the Younger
 “It was absolutely terrific,” she says
 “The brushwork was wonderful – so smart and exciting
”
However, some of the paint had flaked off – and, in several places, bare wood was visible
 So, Holford secured areas of vulnerable paint using an adhesive called isinglass
 “It comes from the swim bladder of the sturgeon,” she says
 “I get it from the Caspian Sea because it’s a by-product of the caviar industry
” Then, the bare patches had to be filled in with gesso (a mix of glue and chalk used as a “ground” or preparatory base layer in a painting) and subtly modelled so that they didn’t appear, as Holford puts it, “horribly flat” – or obviously modern
(Credit: Holburne Museum, Bath)
Holford used watercolour paint to fill in the exposed areas – watercolour can be easily removed later on if necessary (Credit: Holburne Museum, Bath)
At last, Holford could begin her own retouching – carefully filling in damaged areas using watercolour – which, crucially, is easily reversible – to mimic the transparency of Brueghel’s thin oils
 “Otherwise,” she says, “if you leave great big areas of loss in something so finely wrought, all you do is look at the islands, and your eye is distracted – you can’t read the composition as a whole
 By closing those bits, suddenly it all pulls together
 It’s amazing
”
This part of the process, Holford tells me, takes the most time
 She estimates that, by the end, she had applied only “0
5%” of the paint now visible on the surface of the conserved picture
 But this still took her six months, working full time
 “I listen to a lot of Radio 4,” she says, smiling
 “You go somewhere in your head and are completely in the moment
”
The results are spectacular
 What before appeared to be a gloomy nocturnal scene, painted by an undistinguished hand, now glows with vibrancy and dynamism, and throbs with life
 “It’s got a spontaneity about it,” says Scott
 “It’s very fresh
” The painting even boasts a newly discovered background of beautifully painted trees suffused with lyrical daylight – which, inexplicably, long after Brueghel’s death, had been overpainted brown
Scott will not comment on the new value of the painting – but a similarly boisterous, though admittedly larger, scene by Brueghel the Younger sold for more than £2
5 million at Sotheby’s in London last December
The Holburne, of course, does not plan to sell its Wedding Dance – so why expend so much time and energy on the painting
 “Because we’ve done right by it,” Scott says
 “As a museum, it’s being at the top of your game
” She pauses
 “Imagine if you went into the Sistine Chapel wearing sunglasses and then they were removed – it’s like that
 Now people can see this painting as it ought to be

Alastair Sooke is Art Critic and Columnist of The Daily TelegraphWhen the New York City mayor Randall Winston on the sitcom Spin City needed advice about writing his memoir, Donald Trump was there
 In Trump’s cameo in a 1998 episode, he swaggers into the mayor’s office, sits in his chair without asking, and claims that writing his books The Art of the Deal and The Art of the Comeback were a snap for him: “First day, nine chapters
”

Donald Trump’s relationship with television dates back 30 years – initially, he appeared most often in cameos on sitcoms like The Fresh Prince of Bel Air (Credit: NBC Universal)
In another cameo, in The Nanny, Trump is a man who carries not one, but two mobile phones – in 1996
 In The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in 1994, his mere entrance causes the family’s resident conservative, Carlton, to faint
 Other highlights of the future president of the United States’ television career include: play-acting a 'hostile takeover' of Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment owner Vince McMahon during a televised wrestling match that ended with him getting slammed to the mat, asking Denis Leary’s character on The Job about whom he was “banging”, and networking with a rich older man trying to woo Samantha on Sex and the City
One rare negative depiction on TV was Sesame Street’s 2005 parody of Trump
And this was all before Trump produced and starred in the reality series The Apprentice from 2004, which allowed him to depict himself as the ultimate businessman
 Long before his run for president, Trump knew the power of TV: popping up on the small screen as a wildly successful tycoon who had earned his arrogance – and making these appearances repeatedly – made him more relevant to many Americans than any journalistic report about his actual triumphs and failures ever could
 His multiple bankruptcies and tarnished reputation among those who knew or dealt with him in real life didn’t matter
 One rare negative depiction on TV was Sesame Street’s 2005 parody, Donald Grump, a character who bragged, “I’m the trashiest
”
JFK was the first TV-ready US president, but Trump is the first TV-star president
Trump dabbled in movies as well: there were cameos in Home Alone 2and The Little Rascals, and the bullying Back to the Future character named Biff was based on him
 But TV made ‘The Donald’
 Before social media, TV was the best way to truly connect with a mass audience
 And his carefully crafted appearances show that he was more interested in – and better at – moulding public opinion of himself than perhaps anything else

John F Kennedy may have been the first TV-ready US president, but Donald Trump is the first TV-star president
 And he’s likely to continue using this particular skill to maximum effect as the ostensible leader of the free world
Telling a story
Trump’s first TV cameo appears to have come on a 1985 episode ofThe Jeffersons titled You’ll Never Get Rich, in which the stars of the show visit Atlantic City, where Trump had casinos
 But one of his earliest appearances as himself in full Trump mode came on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, which shows him and then-wife Marla Maples grandly introduced to Will Smith and his wealthy Los Angeles family members
 Will’s cousin Hilary gushes, “You look much richer in person
”
One of his reps objected to a reference to him as a millionaire and not a billionaire
Trump’s subsequent portrayals of himself follow a similar, carefully crafted pattern
 In fact, at least one showrunner who worked with him, The Nanny creator Peter Marc Jacobson, revealed to the New York Times exactly how closely Trump monitored his own image: after reading a script for Trump’s episode, one of his reps objected to a reference to him as a “millionaire”
 “Since he’s a billionaire,” the script note said, “he would like the line changed accordingly
” Jacobson settled on the noncommittal “zillionaire”
(Credit: NBC Universal)
The Apprentice was a reality show in which Trump would assess potential employees then dismiss failed candidates with the catchphrase “You’re fired
” (Credit: NBC Universal)
This string of closely monitored cameos seemed unremarkable at the time they aired, nothing more than brand-building for a businessman
 But they accomplished two stunning things: firstly, they convinced US viewers that Trump was an unequivocally successful businessman oozing with star quality
 Secondly, they served as Trump’s audition tape for his reality show The Apprentice, which allowed him to play himself as a wildly successful boss with dozens of young, attractive applicants begging for his approval
The Apprentice transformed him from a New York City tabloid figure into a 'red state' TV star
Trump told the Washington Post that he ignored the advice of his agent when he signed on to host The Apprentice in 2004
  The show, which premiered when reality TV fever was at its height, was a genuine smash its first few seasons, with 20 million viewers watching in the first year
 The Post says that Trump realised the series’ potential to reach a younger audience and that he insisted on inserting his name into the production as much as possible: for instance, in the copious shots of his private plane, "TRUMP" emblazoned across its side
(Credit: NBC Universal)
The Apprentice was such a ratings success that network NBC asked Trump to poke fun of his wealth by singing the Green Acres theme at the 2006 Emmy Awards (Credit: NBC Universal)
He also negotiated a 50% ownership stake in the show, and his first-season turn changed TV network NBC’s plan to rotate the host – other moguls like Richard Branson and Martha Stewart were slated to appear in future seasons – so that The Apprentice became a one-man show
 (A later Stewart spinoff fizzled quickly
)
Platform for the presidency
Trump’s catchphrase – "You’re fired
" – made him into the ultimate reality show truth-teller
 He was Simon Cowell with a very American twist, a message that pointed criticism makes US businesses, and thus America as a whole, stronger, and that hard work is rewarded
 The Apprentice transformed him from a New York City tabloid figure into a TV star recognised in the heart of the Midwest – which would become key territory in his presidential campaign

Trump even appeared on the wrestling programme WWE Raw, in which he shaved wrestling guru Vince McMahon’s head before getting body slammed (Credit: Getty Images)
The Apprentice has long since faded as a hit, even with an all-celebrity edition airing the last few seasons
 In fact, Trump – though he’s still an executive producer on the show – mocked his replacement this season, Arnold Schwarzenegger, for failing to live up to what he called “the ratings machine, DJT
” Ratings are in fact down, but they have been trending that way for several seasons

By the time he announced his run for president in June 2015, Trump buried his competitors for the Republican nomination in name recognition, thanks almost entirely to television
 Reports of his business failures or the alleged swindling via Trump University couldn’t compete with what audiences had seen on TV: a business genius, a “zillionaire”
 His ability to jazz up a boring reality show scene with a wild gesture or comment, meanwhile, translated easily on the campaign trail, boosting ratings for cable news networks that covered him
After Trump’s election upset, former Apprentice producer Bill Pruitt expressed regret for having gilded the businessman’s image for the viewing public
 He explained in an email to Vanity Fair that with the show, “some clever producers were putting forth a manufactured story about a billionaire whose empire was, in actuality, crumbling at the very same time he took the job, the salary, and ownership rights to do a reality show
 The Apprentice was a scam put forth to the public in exchange for ratings
 We were ‘entertaining,’ and the story about Donald Trump and his stature fell into some bizarre public record as ‘truth
’”
Now, the facts about his business record hardly matter in the face of a much larger truth: the man who played a zillionaire on TV is the new president of the United States
“I see cinema as celluloid poetry,” says screenwriter Luke Davies in a video revealing the graft behind the polished script
 “Your operating system is made up of the most elemental units of communication: words
 Ultimately that’s what interests me, the power of the words as individual units
”
Davies started out as a poet, but had been obsessed with cinema since watching Werner Herzog’s Aguirre, The Wrath of God at the age of 16
 He wrote the screenplay for Life (directed by Anton Corbijn), and his latest script, for the film Lion, garnered him an Oscar nomination
He describes his process, revealing the workings behind the scenes on a new six-part TV adaptation of Joseph Heller’s novel Catch 22
 Despite a shift in output, he doesn’t believe he has changed career
 “As a screenwriter I still strive to be a poet,” he says
 “The one thing doesn’t have to replace the other
”Silence, an adaptation of Shūsaku Endō’s novel about Jesuit priests in 17th Century Japan, has been described as Martin Scorsese’s ‘passion project’, but there are few Scorsese films to which that description does not apply
It can be tempting to divide Scorsese’s career into commercial projects and personal ones (ie those unlikely to make much money)
 But if you look closely at the former - The Wolf of Wall Street, say, or The Departed, which won Scorsese his first, and to date, only Oscar - you’ll find his signature scribbled in the margins like a message to the faithful
Although they are filled with the desire to spread the good word, the Portuguese Jesuits Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver) are forced to preach in secret, away from the watchful eye of the Tokugawa shogunate
 Japanese Christians caught practicing their faith are subject to horrendous tortures, slowly scalded to death or hung upside-down with their heads in a pit, and the priests who minister to them can expect even worse
Remove the period garb, and Garfield’s wild, upswept hair wouldn’t be out of place on a clipboard-toting canvasser buttonholing passersby on a city street
But their greatest fear is giving into the demand to apostatise, to renounce their faith and publicly blaspheme their god, as Rodrigues and Garupe fear their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has been compelled to do
 Reports filter back to Portugal that Ferreira has disappeared, that he may be dead, may have abandoned his calling, may even have taken a Japanese name and a Japanese wife
 So the two embark on a journey to find out what has become of him, and whether the faith can survive in his absence
Silence, which was adapted by Scorsese and his Gangs of New York/Age of Innocence collaborator Jay Cocks, strangely elides the reason for the shogunate’s persecution of Christians, which followed in the wake of an uprising by Japanese Catholics in 1637 and ’38
 But this is not a film about history, despite its historical setting, or even particularly about Catholicism, with which Scorsese has long struggled in his work
Liam Neeson 
Rodriguez and Garupe fear their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has been compelled to renounce his faith (Credit: Alamy)
Rodrigues and Garupe aren’t sainted holy men but earnest emissaries; remove the period garb, and Garfield’s wild, upswept hair wouldn’t be out of place on a clipboard-toting canvasser buttonholing passersby on a city street
 And like one of those liberal do-gooders,Rodrigues is at risk of being blinded by his own dedication, unable to see what the people he preaches to are really taking in, and unwilling to contemplate the implications of his actions from any perspective but his own
Keeping the faith
Rodrigues works his way through several antagonists of varying ideological bents
 Some seem truly committed to wiping out the scourge of Christianity, others more like sadists-for-hire
 His ultimate adversary - the final boss, if you will - is Inoue, played by Yi Yi and Tony Takitani’s Issey Ogata
 Although the torments he devises for those who practice the forbidden religion are truly diabolical, Ogata’s inquisitor is very nearly a comic figure, speaking English in a high-pitched, melodic voice as if reciting the punchline to some darkly private joke
Like The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence is a movie that perches on both sides of a divide, pitting one form of monstrousness against another
Until his arrival, Silence plays more or less like a straightforward story of religious persecution, but like Dostoevsky’s inquisitor, he puts to Rodrigues a series of questions that shake the foundations of his faith, and tie it at last to the long and bloody history of European colonialism
Rodrigues is mainly concerned with preaching to the converted, but Inoue reminds him how so many Japanese were induced to take up Catholicism, and, more importantly, to what end
Like The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence is a movie that perches on both sides of a divide, pitting one form of monstrousness against another
 It’s a profoundly moving story, and a profoundly, and deliberately troubling one
 Inoue’s innovation is to threaten Rodrigues not with physical harm but with spiritual torment, especially the agony of watching his fellow Christians suffer
 He confronts him with the idea that his piety is merely a form of vanity, that if he worships a god, and especially a Christ, who sacrificed himself for humanity’s sake, then he ought to be able to do likewise, even if that sacrifice is public blasphemy
Is he meant to follow Jesus’s example, or is to emulate him an act of the most profound hubris
 At the moment before he is finally captured, Rodrigues sinks to his knees and catches his reflection in the water, and for a moment it gives way to a drawn image of Christ’s face
 It could be a vision or merely a desperate hallucination; how we see it depends on our own faith
The most nagging question in Silence occurs in the realm where evangelism and artistic creation overlap
 Towards the end of his journey, Rodrigues is at last brought to question whether the people he’s ostensibly converted even know what they’re worshipping
 They call themselves “Kirishitan”, and they disguise their icons and even their prayers as Buddhist practices - but in doing so, are they keeping the faith or perverting it
Can one’s belief ever be conveyed to another, or is it only ever between them and the gods they worship
 Scorsese has been etching his beliefs onto celluloid for almost 50 years, and their meanings remain as evanescent, as mysterious, as ever
 Silence is not a film to be solved, or resolved, but pondered
 It’s not a parable
 It’s a koan
“I liked the fact that it was a complete portrait of a woman – so many things happen to her, there are such multiple layers in the character
 Like a sculpture, you can turn around her and take her in from so many angles
” Isabelle Huppert describes the character that has garnered her a nomination for best actress at the Oscars
She plays a rape victim seeking revenge on the man who attacked her in Elle, a drama from Basic Instinct director Paul Verhoeven
 Based on the 2012 novel Oh… by Philippe Djian, the psychological thriller has drawn rave reviews and won the Golden Globe Award for best foreign language film
Huppert’s performance has been praised as “a high-water mark” of her career
 She was drawn to the film because it “doesn’t give any explanations, it doesn’t give any solution
 You step into this woman’s life and you try to understand her,” she says
 “You try to understand what leads her from A to B”
It would seem reasonable to wonder if Giovanni Balducci – a painter, trained under Vasari, whose work includes the frescoed interiors of the Uffizi, Volterra Cathedral and the Duomo in his own city of Florence – ever asked how his career had come to this
By the early 17th Century, Balducci was working in Naples
 He took on a project painting portraits of princesses, magistrates and judges in the Basilica of Santa Maria della Sanità, a church that had just been built in the neighbourhood of Rione Sanità
These portraits, though, were rather unusual
 All of the subjects were dead – and Balducci was frescoing their portraits and background scenes around their skulls, which were mounted to the walls
Beneath the Basilica of Santa Maria della Sanità lies this gallery of ghoulish portraits

Even today, few people know of this cycle of some 20 frescoes that line the 30m (96ft) tunnel in the catacombs of San Gaudioso, located beneath the basilica
 Until a little more than ten years ago, they weren’t even open to the public
 But in 2006, young people from Rione Sanità launched the cultural co-operative La Paranza to bring an economic boost to a neighbourhood usually known for crime and Mafia ties, by reviving and protecting the area’s cultural heritage
 The group still manages the catacombs and has funded several restorations, including of some of the frescoes
Over time, these faces became skulls and then, eventually, nothing
Despite its relative obscurity, the tunnel here must be one of the most macabre art galleries in the world
 Over the centuries, most of the bone fragments have fallen away
 But what remains is still chilling
 In one portrait, two princesses stand side by side, full skirts abruptly topped with their frescoed rib cages
 In another, a magistrate stands, feet apart, blue robes yawning open to reveal the skeleton beneath
 (The inscription around his head reads, “Diligete iustitiam qui iudicatis terram”: Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the Earth)
 Still another figure leans on a sword
All were once the wealthiest members of Neapolitan society; all now have holes where their desiccated heads once were
 Over time, these faces became skulls and then, eventually, nothing, as those too crumbled away
 Time erases even the most noble and illustrious among us

Among those moved by this particular show of equality in death was Totò, an Italian actor born in 1898 who, though best known for his 97 comedy films, was also a poet
 Growing up in Rione Sanità, he was a frequent visitor to the catacombs of San Gaudioso
 It’s here, it is said, that he was inspired for his most famous poem, ’A Livella, in which the narrator encounters the bickering spirits of two bodies interred next to each other: a noble marquis and a lowly garbage collector
 “Caste is caste and must, indeed, be respected,” the marquis reprimands his neighbour
 “Not a moment more can I tolerate your stinking proximity
” But his ‘inferior’ is the one who has the last word
 In Neapolitan dialect, he replies:
Who do you think you are… a god
In here, don't you get it that we are all equals
Dead are you, and dead so am I;
Each person, once gone, is the same as another
The marquis’ attitude may have been shared by some of the nobles interred here, who probably paid – in some form or another – for this kind of resting place
 “All of these nobles were documented benefactors of Santa Maria della Sanità, and it is possible that the treatment was part of the benefits they received in exchange for being patrons,” said Carlo Avilio of the University of Warwick, who has written about the catacombs
 (Religious congregations that run small chapels, and which you can join by paying an annual fee, still exist in Naples, he noted; your membership guarantees prayers for the salvation of your soul and a place in their cemetery for burial)

‘Lava of the virgins’
The catacomb complex was probably first dug around the 4th Century BC not for burials, but to extract tuff, the stone used to build the city’s powerful walls
 A soft, volcanic rock, tuff is not only easy to dig out, but to dig through – one reason why people have been digging tunnels, cisterns and cemeteries in Naples for at least 2,400 years
Today Rione Sanità is one of the city’s most colourful, bustling quarters

In antiquity, Rione Sanità was located outside of the city walls
 Roman law required that the dead be buried outside the sacred boundaries of a city (the pomerium) and the area later became, like its more famous neighbour the catacombs of San Gennaro, a huge necropolis
 By the 5th Century, the burial rites carried out here were no longer pagan, but Christian – and the most famous interment in this particular cemetery was of St Gaudiosus, a north African bishop who founded a monastery here before his death in 452
The faithful wanted to spend eternity as close to the saints as possible
As in catacombs elsewhere, the faithful wanted to spend eternity as close to the saints as possible
 Other burials followed
 So did sacred art as people decorated the tombs, some of which can still be seen today, like a colourful, 5th-Century fresco of St Peter introducing Pacentius to St Paul, and over the tomb of Gaudiosus, a portrait of the saint himself

Today, these catacombs are underground – but this is only recently the case
 “Right now, we’re not ‘under the ground’,” said our guide Miryam Cuomo as we stood – underground – at the catacombs entrance
 “We’re simply at the depth that was the original ground level of the Rione Sanità in the 5th Century
”
Ground levels usually rise over time, but the phenomenon is particularly pronounced here
 Rione Sanità is located in a valley overlooked by five hills; when it rained, mud and rock – poetically named the lave dei vergini (lava of the virgins) – would slide down
 After the 9th Century, when the relics of San Gaudioso and other saints were moved into churches within the city walls, the catacombs were abandoned, then buried in the lave

In the 16th Century, as the population of Naples grew and spread back into the once-abandoned area, something strange happened
 Another inundation of lave dei vergini pushed aside rubble that had been left by an earlier slide – and uncovered a 6th-Century painting of the Madonna and child, which remains the oldest image of the Virgin Mary found in this area of southern Italy
 It was decided that a new church, named the Basilica di Santa Maria della Sanità, should be constructed here
Grisly lair
But building a church costs money
 Fortunately, there was just the practice to pay for it
 The church’s wealthy benefactors had their bodies treated by schiattamuorti
 Although the word today has come to mean simply ‘undertaker’, its literal meaning – ‘killing the dead’ – is far more telling
 The cadaver would be seated on a cantarella, a chair-shaped niche carved out of the tuff in one of three underground cellars; every so often, a schiattamuorto would go down to make incisions
Cadavers would be sat in one of the cantarelle, shown here, to be drained

“They would do this to quickly drain the bodies – we’re talking about the blood, organs, all of the liquids which our bodies are comprised of,” said Cuomo
 She paused
 “Macabre enough for you
”
After he died in 1270, the French king Louis IX was eviscerated, then boiled, so that his bones could be cleanly transported to Paris
As gruesome as it sounds, and as unusual as it was – corpses at the time were usually buried in churches without treatment – the practice of draining and cleaning bones makes some sense, particularly in hot climates
 It was also a practice that went back centuries for individuals who were considered very important or holy
 After he died in north Africa in 1270, for example, the body of the French king Louis IX was eviscerated, then boiled, so that his bones could be cleanly transported to Paris
 The story of William the Conqueror’s death in 1087, on the other hand, was a cautionary tale of what could go wrong if human remains weren’t treated with such care: when clerics tried to force his body into a too-small sarcophagus, it burst

This would not be the fate for Neapolitan nobles who opted for the work of the schiattamuorti
 Instead, once drained, their bones would be cleaned and laid to rest in the catacombs
 For a rare few, the church could go a step further
 Once desiccated, the deceased’s head would be detached, plastered onto the wall above his or her tomb – and painted in fresco by Balducci
 “By doing this, the Dominicans in ten years probably recovered a great part of the cost of constructing the basilica above us,” Cuomo said wryly
Predominantly, throughout Catholic theology, the soul is in the head – Emily Guerry
The practice was seen as a sacred one
 The head, after all, was thought to be the sedes anime: the seat of the soul
 “Throughout the Middle Ages into early modernity, there are all of these arguments about where the soul is in the body
 Sometimes people say it’s in the blood, which goes way back – even the Mayans thought that,” said the University of Kent’s Emily Guerry, a medieval historian who is writing a book on the iconography of beheading in Christian art
 “But predominantly, throughout Catholic theology, the soul is in the head
 That really starts to be a firm concept after Aristotelian thought penetrates universities from the 12th Century onwards
”
Relics, too, reflected the importance of the skull
 “The head is thought to have the whole praesentia, presence, and potentia, power, of the person,” Guerry said
 “The best relic you could have of a saint was its head: that’s where he can talk to you, he listens to you – those parts of his personality are meant to linger in his corporeal deposit in the head
”
The nobles had their heads kept separate

Although using the skull not only as a relic, but in a work of art, might seem bizarre, the practice goes back some 9,500 years: in the decorated skulls of Jericho, people added plaster and ‘eyes’ from shells
So perhaps shouldn’t be surprising that, as macabre as this gallery is, being buried here was seen as an honour
 Such an honour, in fact, that even Balducci – far from regretting the path that had brought him from painting the interior of Florence’s cathedral dome, into this grim, dank place of death – refused to be paid for the work
Instead, he made one request: that his body be treated by the schiattamuorti and that he have a place in the gallery as well, his skull – and soul – kept in one of the most elite, and sacred, spots in Naples
The Lost City of ZThis true-life drama, based on a book by David Grann and directed by James Gray (The Immigrant), follows a British explorer who disappeared in 1925 after discovering signs of an ancient civilisation deep in the Amazon rainforest
 Charlie Hunnam (Pacific Rim) stars as the colonel who returns to the jungle repeatedly in an attempt to prove the existence of a lost city – his story is at once a classic adventure and “a far quieter, more ruminative, and confidently intimate movie than that would suggest”
 According to The Telegraph’s Robbie Collin, it’s “a film as transporting, profound and staggering in its emotional power as anything I’ve seen in the cinema in years”

LoganIn what is said to be Hugh Jackman’s last outing with the knuckle blades, comic book CGI and supersized heroism are eschewed for a wholly different style of film
 According to BBC Culture’s Jessica Kiang, “Logan does go defiantly against the grain by favouring melancholic mood and themes of mortality and deterioration over inflated, end-of-the-world stakes or grandiose action pyrotechnics”; Variety called Logan “a scruffy dystopian road Western that takes its time in a way that most slam-bang superhero movies don’t”
 It’s 2029, and Wolverine is one of the only mutants left
 He looks after a 90-year-old Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), kept under sedation lest his degenerative disease unleashes his ‘weapon of mass destruction’ brain, and agrees to drive a young girl to a refuge for mutants
 Director James Mangold offers an elegy to a broken, drunk Wolverine whose powers are fading, and in doing so creates “a Marvel movie with a bit of soul and some true grit”

Ghost in the ShellIn this live-action remake of the cult manga series written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow, Scarlett Johansson (Lucy, Under the Skin) revisits cerebral sci-fi as a cybercop with a human soul
 Yet by casting the American actress, the film’s makers have been accused of creating a “bizarre whitewashed vision of the land of the rising sun”
 According to The Guardian, the original film dwarfed Westworld and Ex-Machina in “scope and intellectual ambition”, looking “beyond the curve of the horizon to the stage beyond that, to the unsettling, darkling reality of our own fusion with technology”: can this version match that
 Directed by Rupert Sanders (Snow White and the Huntsman), it co-stars Juliette Binoche and Pilou Asbæk – and Johansson appears to have given a lot of thought to the part
 “She’s living a unique experience,” the actress told Empire, “as somebody who has an idea of who she thinks she was, and then who she is now, and the person that she feels she is, this sort of gnawing feeling she has in her ghost
 Being able to play those three sides: the ego, the superego and the id

Certain WomenAuteur Kelly Reichardt (Night Moves, Meek’s Cutoff) has drawn praise for her latest film, with Sight and Sound describing it as “powerful, focused, nervy, lean… a work of art produced by a director in full control of her material
 It leaves you reeling
” Michelle Williams, Kristen Stewart, Laura Dern and Lily Gladstone star as four women in Montana with intersecting lives: based on the short stories by Maile Meloy, the film is a series of vignettes set against the vast skies of the American Northwest
 According to The Washington Post, “Reichardt lets her flawed, enigmatic heroines be, allowing them to keep struggling, persevering and relishing what can sometimes pass for tiny victories”

Beauty and the BeastAway from the saccharine music and sweeping ballgowns of the trailer, Beauty and the Beast has been associated with some unlikely themes
 In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly headlined ‘Emma Watson addresses questions over beast relationship’, the film’s star discussed theories that the fairy tale was actually a thinly-veiled story of abuse
 “It’s something I really grappled with at the beginning; the kind of Stockholm Syndrome question about this story,” she says
 “That’s where a prisoner will take on the characteristics of and fall in love with the captor
” But, she argues, Belle doesn’t fit that “because she keeps her independence, she keeps that freedom of thought”
 In the live-action retelling of the studio’s animated classic, Dan Stevens plays the Beast, while Kevin Kline plays Maurice and Ewan McGregor voices the candlestick Lumiere

 Kristen Stewart stars as a Paris-based personal shopper who also claims to be a medium, attempting to bridge the gap between the living and the dead
 According to Sight and Sound, she has “an enigmatic, warily frayed-yet-unafraid presence, almost as if she’d be happy to step over to the ‘other side’ at any moment”, and Assayas handles the haunting to create “a masterpiece of tension-building”
 It’s part psychological drama exploring the terrain of grief, and part supernatural spine-tingler: “Assayas serves up a couple of genuinely frightening effects set pieces”, says the AV Club

The Other Side of Hope (Credit: Credit: Sputnik)
The Other Side of HopeThe second part in Aki Kaurismäki’s putative ‘dockyards trilogy’ is “a gently loving fable with a straightforward political message that home can be wherever you find it”, according to Sight and Sound
 The Finnish film-maker’s first feature in six years drew five-star reviews when it premiered at this year’s Berlin Film Festival, with The Telegraph describing it as a “gorgeous, cuttingly poignant, and soon, surely, to be prize-winning” comedy
 Following a Syrian asylum seeker as he arrives in Helsinki and attempts to find a life for himself, it displays Kaurismäki’s signature wit, balancing bleakness with warmth
 As The Hollywood Reporter put it, “this is a world that reeks of cigarette smoke and cheap vodka, yet as always in the work of Finland’s maestro of droll melancholy, the perfume that lingers longest is empathy”

 (Credit: Sputnik)Up until its very last moments, this year’s Oscar ceremony, as satisfying as it was in many ways, was perhaps a little too slick, a little too polished, a little too full of dignified professionals doing their job exactly as planned
 And then suddenly it wasn’t
 The presenters of the best picture award, Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, were handed the wrong red envelope
 Instead of having the best picture card inside, it had the one for actress in a leading role, and because that card said “Emma Stone, La La Land”, Dunaway announced that La La Land had won the evening’s ultimate award - just as most of us had expected
It was only after the team behind La La Land had crowded onto the stage and got halfway through their acceptance speeches that the muddle was pointed out, and the film’s producer, Jordan Horowitz, had to declare that the best picture winner was actually Moonlight: a task he accomplished with monumental grace and composure
 It was a twist worthy of M Night Shyamalan – as Shyamalan himself tweeted
 For Barry Jenkins’s poetic low-budget drama to have won best picture at that point would have been a major upset in itself: La La Land had just piled up prizes for production design, cinematography, song, score, actress and director
 But for it to have won in such a head-spinningly bizarre fashion made for one of the most memorable Oscar ceremonies ever

Jimmy Kimmel was relaxed and funny – a natural Oscars host (Credit: Getty Images)
The evening’s MC, Jimmy Kimmel, rounded off proceedings by taking the blame for the cock-up, and promising he wouldn’t be back, but in fact he was a natural Oscar host
 Consistently funny, but as relaxed as if he were sitting behind his talk-show desk, Kimmel set the tone for a brisk yet laidback, feelgood evening, a tone was he maintained even during his inevitable attacks on Donald Trump
 In response to the US president’s tweet in which he called Meryl Streep “overrated”, Kimmel riffed on her “lacklustre career”
 After Linus Sandren, the Swedish cinematographer of La La Land, had accepted his award, Kimmel joked: “We’re so sorry about what happened in Sweden last week
” And he sent two Tweets to Trump, an anaemic prank but one which went down remarkably well in the Kodak Theatre
‘Show, don’t tell’
But these were jibes rather than full-blooded rants
 Kimmel’s quietly subversive thinking seemed to be that everyone there was in agreement about the President’s failings, so they weren’t worth getting worked up about: it was better just to accept them and get on with the show
 Many of the award presenters and recipients appeared to agree with him
 It’s true that people kept mentioning truth and tolerance and “opposing without hatred”, in Mark Rylance’s words, and that some people were more specific
 Gael Garcia Bernal described actors as “migrant workers”, and added that, “As a Mexican, I’m against any sort of wall that wants to separate us
” Asghar Farhadi, the director of The Salesman, which won best foreign language picture, chose not to attend the ceremony in solidarity with his fellow Iranians who had been banned from travelling to the US
 But the ad hominem vitriol some of us were looking forward to never flowed
 No one excoriated Trump as fiercely as Streep did at the Golden Globes in January
 And yet the show’s political content snowballed, slowly but surely, until it had the force of an avalanche
 The intriguing thing about this political content was that it followed one of the paramount rules of screenwriting: “Show, don’t tell
”
It was as if the whole ceremony had taken its cue from Michelle Obama’s motto, ‘When they go low, we go high’
It was there when Katherine Johnson, the 98-year-old former NASA mathematician played by Taraji P Henson in Hidden Figures, was wheeled onto the stage: a reminder that the institutional racism and sexism the characters endure in the film are still within living memory
 It was there in the tribute to international film and international film fans; it was there in the Moana anthem sung by Auli’i Cravalho, a mixed-race Hawaiian; and it was there in the choice of presenters and winners from all backgrounds, including Bernal, Salma Hayek, Riz Ahmed and David Oyelowo
 The ceremony’s message was that people of all races and all cultures already make and watch the same films, and that’s something to be celebrated, not feared
 And it was a message that was all the more cogent because it wasn’t articulated in long sermons, it was embodied by the sheer range of people in the room
 It was as if the whole ceremony had taken its cue from Michelle Obama’s motto, “When they go low, we go high
”

Still, it was possible to admire and to enjoy the ceremony while being slightly disappointed that it wasn’t a bit more shocking
 To be fair, history had been made in several ways: at the age of 32, Damien Chazelle was the youngest person to win a best director trophy, and Mahershala Ali was the first Muslim actor to win an Oscar
 But most of the high-profile awards went the way the bookmakers thought they would go
 And La La Land’s best picture win seemed utterly inevitable when Beatty strolled onstage to mention “respect for diversity and freedom all over the world” – earning a brief here-he-goes-again chuckle from Dunaway
 But then the fiasco happened which woke us all up with a start
 And that includes those of us who were watching in the UK, where the time was 05:30 GMT
When those gleaming statuettes were snatched from the hands of the La La Land posse and passed onto the makers of Moonlight – who were quick to affirm that they were La La Land fans – the Academy finally proved that it now judges the best picture according to the merits of the films
 Even a challenging indie story about a gay black youth with a crack-addicted mother can win Hollywood’s prize if it is good enough
 And Moonlight is definitely, gloriously good enough
It’s a shame that this groundbreaking win will always be associated with the envelope mix-up, and it’s wrenchingly sad that the people who made both films had their various triumphs sullied
 But there is no doubt that this year’s Oscars will be remembered for all the right reasons, as well as the wrong ones

McCurry was inspired by a great Hungarian pioneer
 “I met the legendary photographer André Kertész shortly after I moved to New York in my early thirties,” says Steve McCurry in the book’s introduction
 “Some of his most intriguing pictures were photographs of people reading
 They were taken over a 50-year period, and were collected in his book On Reading, published in 1971
” McCurry’s new book is, he argues, “my homage to Kertész’s talent, his influence, and his genius”

In the 1973 book Looking at Photographs, the Museum of Modern Art photography curator John Szarkowski wrote that “Kertész had never been much interested in deliberate, analytical description; since he had begun photographing in 1912 he had sought the revolution of the elliptical view, the unexpected detail, the ephemeral moment – not the epic but the lyric truth

 On her Brain Pickings blog, Maria Popova describes the different roles of reading
 “For Kafka, books were ‘the axe for the frozen sea within us’; for Carl Sagan, ‘proof that humans are capable of working magic’; for James Baldwin, a way to change our destiny; for Neil Gaiman, the vehicle for the deepest human truths; for Polish Nobel laureate Wislawa Szymborska, our ultimate frontier of freedom

Hesse encapsulated the transformative nature of reading in his 1930 essay The Magic of the Book: “Among the many worlds that man did not receive as a gift from nature but created out of his own mind, the world of books is the greatest… Without the word, without the writing of books, there is no history, there is no concept of humanity
 And if anyone wants to try to enclose in a small space, in a single house or a single room, the history of the human spirit and to make it his own, he can only do this in the form of a collection of books
”

“With all peoples the word and writing are holy and magical,” wrote Hesse
 “Naming and writing were originally magical operations, magical conquests of nature through the spirit, and everywhere the gift of writing was thought to be of divine origin
 With most peoples, writing and reading were secret and holy arts reserved for the priesthood alone
”

Theroux describes the nature of that magic in his foreword
 “A great part of the appeal of reading fiction is the discovery that the reader knows much more of the inner life of the characters in the book than of his or her own family members or friends
 The intensity of the reading experience, impossible to communicate to a non-reader, is why fictional characters seem real, exemplary, tragic, comic and accessible… The great books cast a spell, admitting the reader to a world sometimes exemplary, like the Polynesian Eden of Melville’s Typee, or to the English dystopia of Orwell’s 1984

They are also a reminder that many people around the world still choose the printed word over a smartphone
 Back in 1930, Hesse argued that “We need not fear a future elimination of the book
 On the contrary, the more that certain needs for entertainment and education are satisfied through other inventions, the more the book will win back in dignity and authority
 For even the most childish intoxication with progress will soon be forced to recognise that writing and books have a function that is eternal
”

Hesse concluded: “It will become evident that formulation in words and the handing on of these formulations through writing are not only important aids but actually the only means by which humanity can have a history and a continuing consciousness of itself
”George Saunders, Lincoln in the BardoSaunders, a masterful short story writer, takes a well-known tragedy in the life of one of the most honoured US presidents as the jumping-off point for his first novel
 Abraham Lincoln’s son Willie died of typhoid at the age of 11 in 1862
 The president mourned as the Civil War raged, its outcome unclear, and with daily reports of rising casualties
 Saunders uses the Tibetan Buddhist concept of ‘the bardo’ – that netherworld between life and death – to centre his mosaic of voices within a vision of grief captured at the cemetery where Willie is buried
 Saunders renders their eloquent voices, and delicately reveals a connection between a father’s grief and Lincoln’s strategic decision to “be brave and resolve the thing

Ludmilla Petrushevskaya, The Girl from the Metropol HotelPetrushevskaya, a celebrated author in Russia, was born in 1938 across the street from the Kremlin in the Metropol Hotel, Moscow’s “most famed residential building”
 While she was an infant, many members of her family of intellectuals were arrested and executed as “enemies of the people”
 This ushered in a childhood of severe deprivation, starvation and isolation
 She eats from the neighbour’s garbage and can’t go to school in winter because she has no shoes

Anders Rydell, The Book ThievesLess well-known than the Nazi party’s systematic looting of artworks from the countries they invaded and their attacks on literature through book burnings and persecution of Jewish and leftist writers was their secret plundering of libraries all over Europe
 The Third Reich’s goal was to capture the right to shape history by stealing, owning and twisting words stored in the libraries, archives, history and memories of Nazi enemies
 Rydell, a Swedish editor and journalist, crosses Europe to investigate “the most extensive book theft in the history of the world” and reports on ongoing restitution efforts
 Some books are irretrievably lost
 Others – like a volume owned by the heroic Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, among the quarter million plundered books in one Berlin library alone – are priceless finds

Stephen O’Shea, The AlpsO’Shea’s enthralling summertime road trip through the Alps begins on the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland and ends in Italy, at the Adriatic port of Trieste
 He reports on scores of daunting hairpin turns, awe-inspiring peaks (Mont Blanc is his first) and colourful fellow travelers, and muses on the Alpine locations of multiple James Bond films
 He also adroitly sketches the historic spots he passes – the Swiss lakeside villa where Mary Shelley conceived Frankenstein in 1816, the place near Davos where Arthur Conan Doyle tried skiing in 1894 (and decided to kill off Sherlock Holmes), Mozart’s birthplace, Heidi-land, the Austrian salt mine where Nazis hid thousands of priceless art treasures
 Breezy and informative, it a reminder of the ever-shifting attitudes toward mountains that have inspired poets and writers for centuries

Christina Baker Kline, A Piece of the World (Credit: Credit: William Morrow)
Christina Baker Kline, A Piece of the WorldKline’s new novel is inspired by Christina Olson, the woman in Andrew Wyeth’s best-known painting, Christina’s World
 Christina, who lives in the house built by her ancestors in Cushing in the Us state of Maine, has been left off-kilter from a childhood illness
 Her bones and joints deteriorate over the years, and her dreams of escape end when a four-year relationship with a Harvard student ends
 One day Wyeth, who spends his summers nearby, asks to use their house as a studio to paint
 He and Christina have an instant bond, and she, her brother Al and the house become constant themes in his work over the decades
 “Sometimes a sanctuary, sometimes a prison, that house on the hill has always been my home,” Baker writes in this beautifully rendered portrait of a woman’s interior life

 Sirleaf was born in 1938, educated in Monrovia and the US (including a master’s degree at Harvard), and served as finance minister
 Jailed by the military dictator Samuel Doe, she went into exile
 In the 2005 presidential elections, Sirleaf generated a huge voting bloc of Liberian women, leading her to victory
 Cooper’s incisive portrait is undergirded by her reporting on the country’s internal power struggles and years of dictatorial rule, Doe’s bloody military coup and civil war sparked by the notoriously brutal Charles Taylor

 Yet despite its height, the urban rooftop has often been neglected
 Jodidio points out that in New York, museums such as the Guggenheim by Frank Lloyd Wright or the original Whitney Museum of American Art by Marcel Breuer did not make full use of their rooftop spaces
 That is now changing: Renzo Piano’s new Whitney has several outdoor terraces open to the public, and the Museum of Modern Art features a roof garden, though this was designed purely to improve the views from neighbouring buildings
 “It cannot be visited or even seen by museumgoers”, says Jodidio
 Created on top of MoMA’s extension by Japanese architect Yoshio Taniguchi, the space appears like an oasis of nature from above, and yet in the tradition of a Japanese ‘dry’ garden, it contains no plants
 Inspired by military camouflage, Smith used plastic rocks, crushed glass, recycled rubber mulch and roof ballast to sculpt artificial nature high above the streets

Guzman Penthouse, New York, by LOT-EK (1996)According to Jodidio, “rooftops have become a prime site for urban renovation and development… beyond the phenomena of excessively high and expensive aeries in the sky”
 While the penthouse is prized real estate, some spaces have been overlooked
 “The attraction of the roof is double: views are of course best, but so, too, urban rooftops have often been neglected and space in these locations can more easily be found and at a lower price than on the ground, where density rules
” New structures can take the form of houses added to the top of existing buildings, such as Shigeru Ban’s Cast Iron House, restoring an 1881 building designed in the “Italianate cast-iron” style
 At the other end of the scale, this penthouse in the shadow of the Empire State Building was created from a truck container
 Inserted into a typical older New York roofscape with a water tank, the modest house includes a compact bedroom beneath a patio – with a bed that moves in and out of the wardrobe on tracks
 Windows are made out of refrigerators and newspaper dispensers, and an internal steel ladder connects the bedroom to the living room

Fichtebunker, Berlin, by Verde Gartengestaltung (2008-9)Some projects absorb themselves into the original structure
 Built in 1876 as a gasholder to supply the lanterns of Berlin, and converted into an air-raid shelter during World War II, the Fichtebunker is the only surviving structure of its type in Berlin
 The steel dome of the structure inspired the radial design of 13 new apartments and gardens built into the roof
 “Clearly most older urban rooftops are neglected – the sort of ‘junk space’ that Rem Koolhaas has written about,” says Jodidio
 “But a combination of rising urban density, high land and construction costs, and interest in ecology have promoted and encouraged the use of areas, even when they are not visible from the ground

Diane von Furstenberg Studio HQ, New York, by WORK Architecture Company (2005-7)Other rooftop structures are a marked contrast to the building beneath
 Praised by New York’s Landmarks Preservation Commission as a “new model of adaptive reuse for the city”, this space is much more than a penthouse, including a store, showroom, and offices alongside an upper-level residence
 With a diamond shape jutting above the pair of restored Victorian brick buildings, it doesn’t attempt to blend in with what’s below
 The architects, “sought with their rooftop protrusion to convince the very conservative officials in charge of the historic district that it was necessary to signal the new function of the Diane von Furstenberg buildings,” argues Jodidio
 He believes that “they succeeded, especially when lit at night it acts as a beacon in the district”

 Contrasting with MoMA’s roof garden, which is designed to be seen from above, the oasis here offers a space for privacy
 As Jodidio points out, a rooftop can also be “a hideaway, a place to be in the city while remaining discreet, or even invisible”; an eastern redbud tree provides shade as well as protection against being overlooked
 It’s also part of a trend towards lifting nature into the sky
 “Rooftop spaces are increasingly being used in urban environments to generate extra green areas, far above the ground,” writes Jodidio
 Towers “have succumbed to the fashion of sky gardens
” For example, the French architect Jean Nouvel has collaborated with the botanist Patrick Blanc hor his One Central Park towers in Sydney, incorporating vertical gardens made up of hydroponic walls

CapitaGreen, Singapore, by Toyo Ito (2012-14)“Plants contribute to energy savings and also to a general feeling of well-being,” in both office spaces and residential buildings, says Jodidio
 In Singapore’s business district, this 245m-high (800ft) tower has a ‘green façade’ – made up of plants – covering more than half of the building’s surface
 The roof-top Sky Forest has 40 different kinds of tree and shrub, and includes a 45m-high (150ft) Wind Catcher that captures cool fresh air and distributes it to every office floor via a ‘cool void’ cutting vertically through the tower
 According to Jodidio, green rooftops offer a means of saving energy that wasn’t acknowledged in the past
 “It seems apparent that one of the most widespread new uses of rooftops is to reduce heat gain or loss,” he says
 “It suffices to look at older skyscrapers anywhere in the world to be convinced that rooftop open spaces and, even more so, greenery were extremely rare above ground level

Vertical Forest, Milan, by Stefano Boeri (2008-14)The architects describe their Vertical Forest as “a tower for trees inhabited by humans… a project for metropolitan reforestation”
 With 800 trees and 5,000 shrubs, which they call “ecology billboards”, the towers equal an area of 7,000 sq m (75,350 sq ft) of forest on flat land
 “Given their usefulness in creating a heat shield, rooftop gardens are likely to become more and more frequent in contemporary architecture,” says Jodidio
 Part of a broader urban renovation project in Milan, the towers were designed for a total of 460 inhabitants, but also 1,600 birds and butterflies
 With foliage changing colour throughout the year, and gardens at every level, it’s a dramatic addition to the urban roofscape

Hedonistic Rooftop Penthouses, Copenhagen, by JDS Architects (2011)Tasked with adding three penthouses to a densely populated area of Copenhagen, the Brussels architects JDS re-imagined the rooftop
 With a lack of courtyard space, they came up with what they call a “missing garden” – taking the form of a sky-high playground, with shock-absorbing surfaces, a grassy hill, a suspension bridge and an outdoor kitchen
 They quote Le Corbusier’s manifesto Five Points of Architecture, with the fifth being the roof garden, which they describe as “restoring the area of the ground covered by the house”
 As they explain, “usually a roof defines a final measure of any construction
 We imagine cities where people will be the last measure of the environment

House K, Nishinomiya, by Sou Fujimoto (2011-12)“Tokyo is a city that can only begin to be understood from a high vantage point,” writes Jodidio
 “The rooftop becomes a way to better understand the seeming chaos of the city itself
” He argues that “it might be expected that Japan, with its very densely populated cities, would be the location of many interesting rooftop projects
 The fact is that aside from numerous golf driving ranges set on top of buildings, gardens and outdoor spaces are relatively rare in Tokyo… where tiny spaces and very small footprints are the rule”
 In an area between Osaka and Kobe, Sou Fujimoto has managed to squeeze a roof garden onto a house with a floor area of just 118 sq m (1,270 sq ft)
 A diagonal slope is dotted with plants and seating, so that the slanted roof becomes another part of the usable area of the house
 According to Jodidio, “The codified or circumspect way that Fujimoto brings nature into his composition in the form of potted trees is a quite specific Japanese notion, where artificiality and nature coincide or cross through each other

 The Athenaeum commented: “Up on the roof, the architects transformed barren tar and unsightly mechanical equipment into a glorious haven,” not only with lush grass but also a wildflower meadow
 According to Jodidio, roof space “is being treated in a much more consequential and thought-out way than might ever have been the case in the past”
 It’s now an essential part of architecture in the city
 “More and more, every inch of urban space is counted and used,” he writes
 “More and more, existing urban roofs will be converted to new uses, and contemporary buildings are less and less likely to be without any roof features
” What architects once thought of as “a leftover area where air-conditioning units or cell phone repeaters were hidden,” has suddenly assumed a new value

 They are self-educated, self-employed and penniless

In 2015, Xu travelled across China, seeking out those aeronauts
 She had read about them in a Dutch magazine, and was inspired to find out more
 “I was deeply touched by the playfulness, inventiveness, flexibility and optimism of the aeronauts… and fascinated by the magical and fairytale qualities of the subject,” Xu tells BBC Culture
 “Fascinated by the rich imagination of these people and their romantic pursuit in contrast to their poor existence
 I wanted to know how they deal with the conflict between their dazzling imagination and their reality; what motivates them to continue; where does their persistence come from and where do their dreams lead them

After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Zhang aimed to build a helicopter that could fly among trees: his latest, with four aeromotors, is still in its test phase (Credit: Xiaoxiao Xu)
One of the aeronauts Xu photographed, Zhang Dousan, was born into a poor family in Chaozhou, Guangdong Province, and started working as a rock-breaker at the age of 13
 Seeing planes on TV inspired him to build his own: according to Xu, “all his friends burst into laughter when they heard his crazy dream, and his wife was always concerned that his test flights would fail”
 Despite not finishing primary school, Zhang studied the planes at a local airport and travelled to Beijing to buy parts at the aircraft factory
He retrieved an engine from the wreckage of a light aircraft destroyed in a typhoon, and in 1998, the first plane he built flew continuously for 500km
 It was a light two-seater aircraft with a 6m-long frame, and Zhang wrote “I’m from Chaozhou
 No striving, no win
” on the aerofoil
 He has built four more aircraft since, including one named Holy Eagle: its aeromotor is a converted car engine, and its control panel was taken from an abandoned plane
 His plan is to design a helicopter that can fly through forests and valleys to reach more people in rescue efforts
 Zhang told Xu: “I love creating
 I wouldn’t build an aircraft that already exists; I want to create my own designs and inventions
”

From their perspective, it’s not about spending 30 years of their lives in order to fly 30m, it’s about spending 30 years of their lives turning the impossible into something tangible – Gover Meit
The 75-year-old farmer from Mianyang in Sichuan Province has built a dozen aircraft since he began working on them in 1984 – as of yet, none have flown
 Because he’s illiterate, the design process has been challenging – one model was based on a pigeon he bought in his village
 Yet he remains undaunted, telling Xu: “To me, making aircraft is a sort of entertainment, in the same way other people love playing Mahjong
 I just feel so happy when I make an aircraft
” His dream is that one day his aircraft will fly high enough to pass over a field of canola flowers
Aiming high
“The aeronauts don’t care about the risks or chance of irredeemable failure
 The mere notion that they might succeed, that they can enrich their lives in pursuit of their fantasies, is enough to drive them to build and fly aircraft until the day they die,” says Meit
 “They call this way of living ‘the aeronautics of life’; from their perspective, it’s not about spending 30 years of their lives in order to fly 30m, it’s about spending 30 years of their lives turning the impossible into something tangible
” Xu’s photos reveal both the heartbreak and the determination of the aeronauts, many of them lost in concentration as they fit parts into place

 Some even laid down their lives for their hobby
 While many of the ‘lucky’ ones – who still live to tell the tale – have spent decades without ever even experiencing the sensation of defying gravity
”
Su Guibin – also from Chaozhou – had worked as a lift mechanic and in IT before becoming obsessed with aircraft
 Challenging himself to build his own helicopter, he pieced the parts together from unexpected sources: the joystick was taken from a video game console
 It was not without risk: in 2014, while flying an aircraft built by a fellow aeronaut, Su crashed into a telegraph pole, leaving him paralysed from the waist down
“I’ve been bedbound for three years,” he told Xu
 “My toes have recently regained some feeling
 However, the doctor said full recovery is still not guaranteed
 The only thing I can do is wait in bed
 A day in bed seems like a year to me
” Even so, according to Xu, “the first thing he plans to do after recovery is fly his aircraft”
 Her photos of him are not downbeat – he lies in bed, or sits in his wheelchair, with an expression that is hopeful rather than defeated

Wang Qiang has also been in several accidents while flying his aircraft
 The barbershop owner from Cixi, Zhejiang Province attempted his first test flight in 2005, at an old airport in the suburbs of Mianyang
 After getting the aircraft ready for hours, he made his attempt at dusk
 “I taxied out, pulled the rod and the front wheel lifted off the ground,” he told Xu
 “Though the aircraft flew quite low – only 2m from the ground – the crowd were thrilled
 I was also taken aback by this moment; it was just so much fun, I was overjoyed
”
The best thing about aeronauts is that we’re bold
 We’re willing to test things out, even if it’s illegal
 Who else would dare to do it
 – He Dongbiao
Yet later flights weren’t so smooth
 “Once I flew to 300m and the engine suddenly shut down
  I attempted to glide safely back to land
 However, before I was able to steer it towards the runway, the aircraft crashed into the river
 I had to swim to the bank and then try to salvage the aircraft
” Another time, the engine failed just after lifting off and Wang crashed in the middle of a construction site
 “The aircraft ended up with its wheels pointing towards the sky and its back facing the earth: I was stuck there, upside down
 Fortunately, I had fastened the safety belt so I didn’t have any injuries
”
Despite that, he’s undeterred
 “Am I afraid after all these accidents
 Yes, but this fear is trivial
 More importantly, I feel increasingly steady and confident
 Every time I had an accident, I made some adjustments that improved the aircraft and made the test flights safer
”

Xiaoxiao Xu’s approach is understated, piecing together images of each aeronaut with the same care that they take when welding together their recycled parts
 Alongside her portraits, the book features earlier photos taken by family members as well as blueprints, some computer-generated with intricate technical details, others just a scribble on a piece of crumpled paper
 We can see Xu Bin’s history as an aeronaut, with photos showing him when he first started building helicopters at the age of 20
 “Because of the small size of our backyard,” says the son of a machinist and a farmer from Jiangshan, Zhejiang Province, “I decided to make a helicopter – a handy option, given they don’t need a runway to take off
”
Highs and lows
There are also blurry snapshots of Xu Bin crashing in a field – and a photo of an aeronauts’ aviation museum that he opened in 2014
 The aeronauts have lofty ambitions – Wang told Xiaoxiao Xu: “China boasts such a vast territory and huge population… there are a lot of aviation amateurs
 If every one of us could fully develop our own innovations and designs, we could further promote our work as aeronauts together – it would be like there was blossom everywhere
”

Xu Bin has started to make a living from his hobby
 “Companies in Guangzhou and Wenzhou have invited him to help with their aerial photography,” says the photographer
 “He sells autogyros and their parts, and also modifies autogyros into crop dusters
”
Gover Meit writes that “some are so successful that their hand-drawn designs get picked up by the commercial market, granting them jobs as aircraft engineers
 Others design mind-blowing new models that neither Nasa nor Hollywood could ever have thought of
 Not only are these farmers able to achieve the impossible, their unimpeded way of thinking is now helping science to discover more efficient and user-friendly ways to fly
” Xu’s photos capture that sense of adventure: on one level, the aeronauts are pioneering engineers; on another, they are still the children who stared wild-eyed at the birds in the sky above and dreamt of joining them
At the end of her travels, the photographer took a flight with Xu Bin
 “My heart pounding, I got into his two-seater autogyro… I cautiously put on my helmet and safety belt,” she says
 “Before long we were flying at 200m altitude
 For a moment I held my breath
 The aircraft has an open design, I felt the wind through my hair and saw the houses, mountains, fields, and lakes passing by below my feet; a feeling of dizziness took hold of me

Xu Bin taught himself how to fly by attaching an autogyro to a moving car with a rope: he’s now chief test pilot for local aeronauts

“Fear set in, and I started to picture how exactly we were going to crash
 But then I spotted Xu Bin looking down below with the curiosity of a little boy
 He shone with intense happiness
 I began to appreciate just how much enjoyment he gets out of flying, from taking to the skies
 Despite the noise of the propeller, I almost reached a moment of Zen
 My fear faded, and I looked out… The lakes below were reflecting the light of the setting sun, everything seemed to glow and soften
 We made a few rounds in the sky, sometimes flying low, sometimes high up, over the fields and mountains
 Fifteen minutes later we had landed again, safely
”

“It has antagonised… and inspired humankind,” says Meit
 “The sight of birds flying wherever they please, while not being able to lift off ourselves
” (Credit: Xiaoxiao Xu)
Xu captures this sense of boyhood curiosity most in her images of Yuan Xiangqiu
 Growing up in poverty in Tiantai, Zhejiang, he taught himself carpentry before being drawn to aircraft
 “I can’t give any specific reasons for why I want to build aircraft,” he told Xu
 “I remember when I was a kid there was a big camphor tree next to our house
 The tree was home to hundreds of birds
 I was fascinated by these birds – their flight was so beautiful, and I wanted to experience the feeling of being airborne too
” He has always believed he can build an airplane
 “Airplanes are similar to birds: wings, body, an engine, and then you can fly
”
“While we in the West are still waiting for some prodigal scientists to invent and develop a James Bond-style jetpack, these Chinese farmers might just be the genuine heroes who enable personal air trafficking in the coming years,” says Meit, acknowledging a universal human impulse
 “We all still dream of flying
 Not by having to buy an expensive ticket and sit in a metal box for hours among hundreds of fellow passengers, but by simply jumping up and taking off to whichever place we’d like to visit, not having to care about traffic jams or financial restraints
 We still long to fly freely, just as birds do
”When a Saudi Arabian music video recently went viral, depicting niqab-clad female singers throwing shapes and chanting lines such as “may men disappear”, the colourful skit was hailed as a challenge to stereotypes
 Yet the spotlight barely shifted: the notion of the voiceless Arab female lingers in the mainstream, despite the fact that Saudi does not reflect the Arab world at large
 In fact, strong-voiced women have been a lynchpin of Arabic music in its far-ranging forms – from folk songs to commercial pop – across many generations and nations
“All of the Arabic women I grew up listening to or watching had a very strong character,” says Lebanese singer-songwriter Yasmine Hamdan
 She began her music career fronting Beirut’s first electro-punk outfit, Soapkills, in the late ‘90s, and is about to release her second solo album, Al Jamilat (The Beautiful Ones)
 “It’s normal; Arab women have always been very active at the forefront of culture – as film producers since the 1920s; as singers, dancers, choreographers, writers for much longer than that
”
The most iconic figure in Arabic music remains the Egyptian singer-songwriter and actress Umm Kulthum, known as ‘the Star of the East’
 Born into an imam’s family at the turn of the 20th Century, she was studying classical repertoire by her teens, and making her mark as an extraordinary vocal talent by the 1920s
 She also starred in several films, including 1937's Nashid Al Amal (The Chant Of Hope), in which she played a divorced single mother working to provide for her daughter; its soundtrack included The University Song, with typical themes of determination, solidarity and national fervour
 She presented womanhood at the forefront of national identity, alongside men, singing about politics as well as romantic epics
(Credit: Alamy)

Umm Kulthum proved an astute businesswoman as well as an accomplished performer; her powerful repertoire and savvy collaborations covered patriotic sentiments as well as yearning serenades, and Hamdan argues that “the unity of the Arab world was embodied in Umm Kulthum’s voice”
 By the time of her death in 1975, she had earned international acclaim
 As musicologist Virginia Danielson writes in Harvard Magazine, “Imagine a singer with the virtuosity of Joan Sutherland or Ella Fitzgerald, the public persona of Eleanor Roosevelt and the audience of Elvis, and you have Umm Kulthum”
The spirit of the original female singers – mellifluous yet headstrong, poetic and political – is embodied in a new generation
Many of the pioneering stars of Arabic music were connected with the emerging ‘golden age’ of Egyptian cinema, which brought their talent and glamour to mass audiences
 Top-billed names included Leila Mourad, from a Jewish Cairene family, and Asmahan, who came from a background of Syrian Druze nobility, and whose mesmerising musical range was cut short with her death in 1944, aged just 31
 The orchestral songs of this era are still Arab pop culture staples, regularly covered alongside current commercial hits on reality shows like Arab Idol; however, the spirit of the original female singers – mellifluous yet headstrong, poetic and political, open to varied styles – is arguably best embodied in a new generation of independent artists
(Credit: Alamy)

Hamdan describes hearing Asmahan’s track Ya Habibi Ta’ala (My Beloved, Come) in a Beirut club at 4am as a musical “epiphany”; she recalls: “It felt extremely elegant, eloquent and emotional; sophisticated and edgy for its time
” On the electronic productions of her debut solo album, 2013’s Ya Nass (Hey People), Hamdan paid homage to the likes of Asmahan and Mourad, as well as legendary Egyptian singer/composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab, through covers and soulful original material
Finding a voice
On her new album, Hamdan mostly focuses on her own songs, written from the perspective of female characters
 “They have a lot of contradictions; I like to show my taste for imperfection,” she laughs
 “These characters are both dominant and fragile, which is beautiful to me
” Choosing to sing in Arabic when her peers were gravitating to Western pop was, in its own way, a form of rebellion
 She told the Guardian: “I felt that the Arabic language was a raw material that could be shaped, freely
 This was something that was thrilling to me
”
Conflicting judgements of ‘respectability’ across the Arab world, about anything from dress codes to lyrics and mixed audiences, are another source of rebellion
 “Well, there are lots of codes in Arabic music, and it’s not easy to break them,” replies Hamdan, who is now based in Paris with her husband (the Palestinian film director, Elia Suleiman), and continues to tour internationally
 “But the conservatism is not only in religion; it can be social or intellectual, and there is a kind of taboo in touching ‘sacred’ older songs
”

The Tunisian-born New York-based protest musician Emel Mathlouthi, whose second album Ensen (Human) has just been released, echoes this sentiment: “We have a lot of female Arab pop stars, so that’s not a problem, but I definitely think that it’s harder when you have your own project,” she says
 “In the Arab world, there are high expectations of good singers, which I really like, but the mainstream also has a very traditional approach, and it’s hard to get away from the image of the ‘static diva’
”
When I sing in my first language, whether in dialect or classical Arabic, the singing has another dimension – Emel Mathlouthi
The so-called “voice of the Tunisian Revolution” is a dynamic and politically conscious performer; her work has regularly tackled inequality and her track Kelmti Horra (My Word Is Free) was embraced as an anthem of the Arab Spring, leading to her performance at the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize Concert
 Mathlouthi cites influences including “the strong vocals and deep songs” of Lebanese superstar Fairuz (who, like her compatriot Sabah, has headlined worldwide venues including New York’s Carnegie Hall, London’s Royal Albert Hall, and the Paris Olympia), and the Egyptian protest singer and composer Sheikh Imam
 She’s also a fan of US singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell – on this year’s International Women’s Day, Mathlouthi is taking part in a concert celebrating Mitchell’s album Hejira at London’s Southbank Centre
Mathlouthi says she wanted her album Ensen “to reflect on the contrasts of Arab Muslim society; this album was a quest about how to connect with heritage, and how to distribute that with a personal touch
” She believes the choice of language itself can be a form of speaking out
 “What I find hard right now is that when a woman sings in Arabic, unless it’s in an exotic context or party music, it blocks her from participating in the mainstream
 Perhaps this is true of most non-English tongues, but when I sing in my first language, whether in dialect or fusha [classical Arabic], the singing has another dimension
 As Arabs, it’s important that we associate our voices with art and positive expressions
”
Beyond the mainstream
By stepping out of the mainstream, many artists can gain more autonomy – and tap into the legacy of strong female Arab artists at the same time
 Around the Middle East, diverse underground and DIY music scenes offer a counterpoint to glossy commercial Arab pop
 Maryam Saleh, a singer-songwriter from Cairo, argues that both female and male players have to strive equally hard in this independent realm, where there is relatively little infrastructure for venues and labels: in fact, compared to male counterparts, she says, “you somehow harbour a sense of empowerment as an independent female artist here”
(Credit: Maryam Saleh)

Of course, strong female voices aren’t always in synch; for Saleh, Umm Kulthum represents a music and business talent who aligned with authority: “Her voice, interpretation, choices and alliances summed up to turn her into an icon and institution
 In the case of female alternative artists today, they are truly independent, as well as being the composers and producers of their own work; [Palestinian singer and musician] Kamilya Jubran is a great example
”
Saleh’s music, such as the track Toul El-Tarie (On All The Roads), is beautifully poetic and gritty, and her songs combine her own lyrics with past and present Arabic poetry, including her Egyptian contemporary Mido Zoheir
 “I’m drawn to texts that unassumingly express sentiments we feel in everyday life… sort of like riddles, satirical, yet they strike very personal chords,” she says
Sarah El-Miniawy, who founded the ground-breaking international music management and PR agency Simsara, argues that “alternative Arabic music, or any non-English speaking music for that matter, is hardly featured in mainstream media; when it is, the framing is within the politics of the region, and that’s the same for both genders
“There is no denying that the environment is tougher on Arab independent artists, and so naturally you become more resourceful with the little you have
 If we go as far as saying that being oppressed inspires you and makes you more determined, then it verges on romanticising a dire reality
 Independent musicians in the Arab world pursue their vocation just like any other musician elsewhere, and they adapt to the lifestyle it brings to them
”
Both El-Miniawy and Saleh point out that, in the digital age, these varied forms in music and arts develop more swiftly than ever
 And it is in this limitless space that more points of connection are made across the Arab world, between genres and generations, with strong female voices shifting shape, confronting reality and summoning fantasy, and continuing to resonate
A make-up designer’s tricks of the tradeThe tributaries of the Rio Negro are teeming with music
 On the outskirts of Manaus, capital of the Amazonas province, there is a symphony of unparalleled variety – the call of the yellow-rumped cacique bird, the cadences of cicadas, the cacophony of capuchin monkeys
 When the water is calm, you can hear the clicking of pink dolphins that glide in the black silted stream
The music of Manaus is not restricted to its wildlife
 The ‘Paris of the Tropics’, as it became known in the late 19th Century, is home to a remarkable cultural monument: the Teatro Amazonas (Amazon Theatre), a majestic opera house that dominates the city’s main square
 Testament to the wealth of Manaus at the height of its rubber boom, the theatre is a curious attempt to replicate European cultural taste in the heart of the tropical rainforest
(Credit: Alamy)

The opera house was inaugurated on 31 December, 1896, after 15 years of painstaking construction and negotiation
 With the exception of locally-sourced wood, all the materials were imported from Europe, and no expense was spared
 One hundred and ninety-eight crystal chandeliers came from Italy, including 32 made from Venetian Murano glass, while Scottish cast iron holds up the 22 vibrating hollow columns that contribute to the excellent acoustics
The most elegant feature of the 700-seat theatre is the curvature of the auditorium, arrayed in the shape of a lyre
 The Italian architect, Celestial Sacardim, modelled the interior on the Palais Garnier in Paris, and the ceiling, painted by a fellow Italian, offers the impression of looking up reverentially at the Eiffel Tower
The theatre’s iconic dome is both innovative and controversial – even to this day
Not all of the artistry is European
 The 75-metre-high stage is adorned with a curtain illustrated by Brazilian painter Crispim do Amaral, which depicts the local water goddess Iara amid the nearby ‘meeting of the waters’, between the black Rio Negro and the milky Rio Solimões
The most imaginative innovation is the iconic dome, created from 36,000 tiles imported from Alsace, upon which a Brazilian flag is emblazoned
 It was during the construction of the theatre, in 1889, that Brazil became a republic, ending the imperial rule of Dom Pedro II
 The new republican spirit, a century after France’s own revolution, is evident in the motto at the centre of the flag, Order and Progress, which derives from the positivist philosophy of a Parisian, Auguste Comte
(Credit: Alamy)
The imaginative dome of the opera house is made from 36,000 tiles imported from Alsace, but it’s also controversial – many deemed it a bizarre addition (Credit: Alamy)
The dome was a controversial construction, and it continues to divide critics, according to tour guide, Samir Torres
 Traditionalists deemed it a bizarre addition – neither formal nor symmetrical, nor of utility (it does not form part of the interior, and the roof had to be reinforced to support its weight)
 While some deride the dome as a ‘big colourful hat’, I think it makes a fitting crown for a building that fuses architectural styles (Renaissance, Baroque, neo-classical)
‘To be seen was more important than to see’
The new civic spirit of the republic did not alter the social mores of the opera’s patrons
 Samir points out that the worst seats in the house, jutting out at the tip of the lyre, were also the most publicly prominent, and raised the most money at auction
 To be seen was more important than to see
Samir is amused by the image of socialites donning layers of formal evening wear in the tropical heat, and he describes the spectacle as “a fashion competition
 People would melt here to show off
”
 To accommodate the modish aspirations of its patrons, the theatre experimented with one of the earliest air-conditioning systems, aiming to provide relief as temperatures soared to 40C (104F) and humidity rose to 90%
Under the energetic governorship of Eduardo Ribeiro, whose contribution is commemorated throughout the theatre, Manaus was transformed from a provincial town to a major seat of commerce and culture
 By the turn of the century, Manaus was the first Brazilian city to have trams and the second with electric lighting
 Dingy streets were transformed into Parisian-style boulevards, bordering Italian piazzas with fountains, while rubber barons commissioned opulent mansions in which they entertained their peers with concerts and parties
In its first two decades, the opera house attracted artists from around Europe
Less grandiose were the living conditions of the workers who constructed the theatre, and in particular those who laboured to tap rubber, many of whom were remunerated only with food and lodging, and found themselves trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty
 Nonetheless, Manaus was not immune to social change: the city became the first to elect a mixed-race governor, whose father was born a slave, and who lived in a residence near the theatre
In its first two decades, the opera house attracted prominent artists from around Europe, but it also helped nurture Brazilian talent
 In the sumptuous ballroom, replete with gold leaf and a floor comprised of 12,000 wood panels, there is a bust of Carlos Gomes, the first New World composer to be celebrated in Europe
 The centrepiece of the room is a painting of Gomes’ most renowned opera, Il Guarany (“the Brazilian Romeo and Juliet”, according to Samir)
A golden age
Manaus’ belle epoque ended almost as abruptly as Europe’s
 In fact, as the theatre was being built, the seeds of the city’s demise were being sown
 An Englishman, Henry Wickham, began to smuggle thousands of rubber pods to British colonies in Malaysia and Sri Lanka
 Within 20 years, these plantations were producing rubber more cheaply and efficiently, and the Amazonian rubber market soon collapsed
 The theatre was forced to close in 1924, and although Manaus experienced a brief revival when Japan occupied British plantations during World War Two, the ‘golden age’ lasted less than three decades
(Credit: Alamy)

The city continued to maintain its theatre, which became a national historic landmark in 1966, and it underwent various renovations: the exterior was changed from pink to blue in 1929, and then to grey between 1972-74, to match the military junta’s colour scheme for all public buildings
 (Evidence of this drab exterior comes in the form of a 30,000-piece Lego model, a gift from Denmark in 1973)
 The facade reverted to its original pink after a public ballot in 1990
For over 70 years, the Teatro Amazonas did not host a performance - except from an intriguing cameo appearance in the opening scene of Werner Herzog’s 1982 film, Fitzcarraldo
 The protagonist of the movie is an opera-obsessed rubber baron who paddles for thousands of kilometres down the Amazon from Iquitos in Peru to Manaus, to watch a performance by the celebrated tenor Enrico Caruso
There is a degree of historical accuracy to this fiction: the first performance at the theatre, on 7 January, 1897, featured Caruso in Ponchielli’s opera La Gioconda
 It was said that the entire opera house was built just to lure him to Manaus, so that the rubber barons could hear the world’s most popular tenor
 More recently, a Bollywood movie was filmed in the theatre, with actors from Mumbai dressed in fin de siècle European attire
The Amazonas Philharmonic has an international reputation – 39 of its 54 members are from Russia, Belarus and Bulgaria
The theatre reopened briefly in 1990, but was forced to close after a fortnight, embroiled in a scandal about accessibility
 (Manaus residents protested on the steps: “We paid for this opening, but we are left outside
”)
 Only in 1997 did the theatre begin to host regular concerts, with the establishment of the Amazonas Philharmonic

When I visited in March, the theatre was gearing up to host the 21st annual Amazonas Opera Festival, which runs from April to May
 A small exhibition showcases costumes from previous productions, including finery from a performance of Bizet’s Carmen in 2014
 The White Stripes gave a concert here in 2004, and the philharmonic has benefitted from an international reputation: of the 54-member orchestra, 39 are from Russia, Belarus and Bulgaria
The theatre has a busy schedule: on consecutive nights, I watched the Amazonas Jazz Band and the Guitar Orchestra, along with a day rehearsal of the Experimental Orchestra
 Each performance was open to all and free to attend, and attended by a capacity crowd that crammed into the once exclusive boxes
On the ceiling of the ballroom, there is a painting titled The Glorification of the Arts in the Amazon, in which gods and goddesses bestow their gifts from above
 For some of its early progenitors, the theatre expressed an idea of culture removed from nature
 They sought to tame a wild habitat with a vision of civilisation cultivated in Paris, and nurtured by men eager for European grandeur
 The spirit of the Amazonas offers an altogether more organic interpretation; so that, in musical terminology, it acts not in dissonance, but in harmony
Making art can be a kind of escape, and it’s hard to think of a place that begs louder for escape than death row
 For inmates facing the death penalty, art offers a way to define their own identity and assert their existence to an audience far beyond the confines of their cell and long after their execution
The relationship between prison and creative pursuit is long and strong
Almost two years after he was put to death, Myuran Sukumaran is the headline artist at the exhibition Another Day in Paradise, currently showing in his hometown of Sydney, Australia
  Sukumaran’s paintings – mostly portraits – were created in his final few years in Bali’s Keroboken jail, where he was incarcerated following his 2005 arrest for his role in the drug trafficking group that came to be known as the Bali Nine

The relationship between prison and creative pursuit is long and strong
 Writing has historically been the go-to creative outlet for prisoners, as it can be achieved with minimal resources and the product can be hidden or secreted in and out of cells
 Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote The Gulag Archipelago from the forced labour camps of the former Soviet Union
 Martin Luther King Jr wrote his Letter from Birmingham Jail while incarcerated in Alabama
 And, in a sign of how art and form evolve with time,  US rapper Gucci Mane even recorded some verses of his 2010 album Burrprint 2 over the phone from prison
If art supplies aren’t available inmates can make paint from crushed sweets or instant coffee
In prisons in the US, Europe and Australia, visual art classes and resources are now available to more inmates than ever before
 These programmes have been shown to have a positive influence on the immediate and long-term behaviour of prisoners – though often the resources allocated to them are scarce
 When these aren’t available, innovation often prevails, with paints made from crushed sweets or instant coffee
Personal statement
The criminal justice system can be dehumanising; the courts and the media often create a narrative that does not align with a prisoner’s idea of their actions or identity
 Art can offer a corrective
 Margot Ravenscroft is the Director of Amicus, an organisation focused on fair trials and other legal issues around capital punishment in the US
 Her organisation often receives art from prisoners on death row
 She says art is one of the only ways inmates can express themselves from prison
Another Day in Paradise 
Sukumaran’s work, largely consisting of self-portraits, gives a sense of the psychological toll of long-term imprisonment (Credit: Brenton McGauchie)
“Generally, but more extremely on death row, part of the incarceration process involves stripping away your identity as a human being,” Ravenscroft says
 “The expression of art is a way of redressing that dehumanisation and identifying yourself as an individual and as a member of society
”
Myuran Sukumaran’s self-portraits do exactly that
 Through them, he shows us ‘Myu’, a sincere young man totally at odds with the intimidating martial arts expert who lunged at photographers on the day his death sentence was first handed down in 2006
 “Myuran forced us to see him for who he was,” says Ben Quilty, Sukumaran’s mentor and an award-winning Australian artist whose acclaimed body of work is a relentless interrogation of masculinity and self-identity
Sukumaran contacted Quilty in 2013 seeking advice on painting technique
 Taken by Sukumaran’s curiosity and dedication to his practice, Quilty became a mentor and ultimately a close friend to Sukumaran during the last four years of the prisoner’s life
Most of the artworks that come out of death row in the US show a longing for the outside world
The real Myuran, according to Quilty, was humble and reflective and completely devoted to his art practice
 It’s that devotion that makes Sukumaran’s work stand on its own as good art, regardless of its origin
 “He was on a mission to find a calling,” Quilty says
 “I think he carried the guilt of what he did to his family every single waking moment of his life
 Finding his calling was going to give him the opportunity to make his family proud
”
Sukumaran was also driven by what Quilty calls “a strong, masculine desire” to leave his mark
 “Myuran was very aware that he created a body of work that would go on beyond his physical body
 He went to his execution knowing that he had created a visual language that would speak out against the barbarism of the death penalty around the world
”
Seen through bars
Prisoners on death row in the US often live in isolation for years and their art practice becomes a lifeline to the outside world
 Most of the artworks that come out of death row there show a longing for the outside world; animals, landscapes, wide open spaces that provide an antidote to the solitary confinement most death row prisoners live in for 23 hours a day
Lethal Injection

But some of the break-through artworks take the opposite approach, tackling the artists’ predicament and preoccupations head on
Art and activism often go hand in hand and art from death row naturally speaks to sensitive socio-political issues
Kenneth Reams is currently awaiting execution in Arkansas for his part in the shooting murder of Gary Turner in 1993 – though it is undisputed that Reams, who was 18 years old at the time of his crime, was not the gunman in the incident
 Over his 23 years on death row, Reams has become a prolific artist and poet
Each of his works reacts to a specific capital punishment issue or case
 His drawings and paintings show thick prison bars, nooses, bullets and electric chairs
Lethal Injection 
Reams directly addresses capital punishment yet in a deliberately abstract way, such as in this painting titled The Long Mile (Credit: Kenneth Reams)
In November 2014 Reams wrote to a supporter about his aim to employ art as a means to educate society about the death penalty in America, “in a fresh new way”
 “I am locked in a small cell pretty much 24 hours a day and a big world exist[s] on the outside of my small box,” he wrote
 “However, from my small box, I will [affect] the world with my work if I am given enough time
” 
Running out of time
At the exhibition of Sukumaran’s work in Sydney, a collection titled 72 Hours fills one wall of the gallery
He said he’d created his best art in his final three days
Over Sukumaran’s 10-year imprisonment in Indonesia, he exhausted all prospects of appeal
 On 5 March 2015 Sukumaran was transferred from Kerobokan prison to Nusa Kambangan, or ‘execution island’
 On 25 April 2015 Indonesian authorities delivered Sukumaran an obligatory 72 hours’ notice of execution
 He painted furiously until his final moments
Another Day in Paradise 
As Sukumaran approached the date of his execution his work depicted himself in a contorted fashion that recalls Francis Bacon (Credit: Brenton McGauchie)
The number and quality of paintings Sukumaran created in his final three days show restless defiance
 Quilty says, “I think he just really wanted to communicate this last desperate thing; to put something in the face of [Indonesian president Joko Widodo] and the Indonesian authorities and say, ‘I’m alive and I’m human
’”
The titles of the 12 paintings in this collection narrate a torrent of emotions: 72 Hours Just Started, Time is Ticking, Falling Apart
 His self-portraits become quite uncomfortable to look at as he introduces cramped and distorted arms and legs
 Quilty says the limbs are a nod to the Anglo-Irish painter Francis Bacon, whose work Sukumaran was studying at the time
 But Sukumaran’s twisted compositions also show a man jammed into the confines of his canvas, or perhaps desperately balling himself up for a return to the womb
Another Day in Paradise

In any event, the deviation from his usual practice in those final 72 hours shows an optimism and ambition that is typical of Sukumaran’s work since he first picked up the paintbrush in 2013
“I’ve never seen anyone progress like Myuran,” Quilty says
 “He worked really hard that whole time, but then in the last 72 hours he created these
” In Sukumaran’s final call to his mentor, he told Quilty that he had made the best art of his life in his final three days and asked, “Imagine if I’d had a couple more years
”For two days each year, the air in India and Nepal is a living canvas, drenched in the rich reds of powdered pomegranate and pulverised hibiscus, the vibrant yellows of crushed chrysanthemums and macerated marigold, and the giddy greens of ground gulmohar leaves
 Revellers attending the annual Holi, or ‘Festival of Colours’, blur the boundaries between artist and art, creator and created, as they fling fistfuls of pigment and buckets of tinted water at each other – friend and stranger alike
 Saturated and singing, festival goers move amid the hubbub of riotous hues like psychedelic ghosts – their bodies dissolving into the endlessly shifting veils of vapourising colour that engulf them
Held each year to celebrate the end of winter and the return of luminous intensity to the budding landscape, Holi has its roots in ancient Hindi culture and is timed with the approach of the spring equinox
 What distinguishes it from other fertility celebrations, however, is its emphasis on the resurrection of colour in the flowering world – colour, that is to say, as a quality prised away from the contours of any particular shape or blossoming crop
 Such unbridled jubilation, with all its chaos of chromatism, seems a grand affirmation of the Romantic essayist Leigh Hunt’s sprightly assertion that “colours are the smiles of nature” – a spontaneous overflow of feeling that we fail to reciprocate at our own diminishment
The instinct to separate a form’s radiant complexion from the material substance of the thing itself has significant parallels in art history and emerged as a driving force behind some of the most important movements of modern art
 A century ago, a clutch of American artists calling themselves ‘Synchromists’ attempted to isolate the rhythms of abstracted colour in a manner analogous to the arrangement of notes by musicians
 Attaching to their works titles such as Cosmic Synchromy (a seminal painting from 1913-14 by one of the group’s founders, Morgan Russell), the movement tried to place its finger on the pulse of pure pigmentation – the eye-music of the spheres
Although crucial to the eventual arrival of a fully-fledged American Abstract Expressionism in the ensuing decades, Synchromism failed to achieve the kind of break-out success enjoyed by a contemporary Russian painter and aesthetic theorist who likewise became obsessed with the difference between the physical forms of nature and the urgency of their colours
 Wassily Kandinsky’s pioneering and influential 1912 text, Du Spirituel dans l’art (or Concerning the Spiritual in Art), gave verbal expression to sentiments that invigorate every ecstatic lob of crushed jacaranda in the air during Holi
 “Colour”, Kandinsky wrote, “is a power which directly influences the soul
 Colour is the keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings
”

Wassily Kandinsky’s Composition VII (1913) appears “to capture the cosmic instant during creation before colour and substance have finally cohered” (Credit: Wikimedia)
Kandinsky’s famous canvas Composition VII, created the year after he published his treatise on the spiritual in art, is a kind of visual accompaniment to the libretto of his manifesto’s ideas and the painting for which he made more preliminary plans than any other in his career
 A vortex of violently churning tinges and tones, the work would appear to capture the cosmic instant during creation before colour and substance have finally cohered under the hammer of the almighty eye
 Traces of figurative details that can connect the work to religious subjects – the Resurrection and Paradise – are swallowed in a deluge of reverence for colour
 Like the photo from this week’s Holi, Kandinsky’s Composition VII is an exuberant acknowledgement of nature’s joyous greeting, and a soulful smile right back
One of the most popular English-language novels of the 20th Century is almost unknown in the English-speaking world – a global phenomenon in translation, now neglected in its original form
 The Gadfly, by Irish writer Ethel Voynich, was a sensation on the other side of the Iron Curtain – it sold over 5 million copies in 107 editions in the 22 languages spoken in the Soviet Union
 The book inspired seven musical adaptations, including an opera by Prokofiev, five theatre adaptations, including an ‘official’ version by George Bernard Shaw, and five film adaptations, one of which featured a famous score by Shostakovich
One of the most exciting novels I have read – Bertrand Russell
Voynich’s novel is a thrilling saga of revolutionary zeal, religious devotion, clerical betrayal and romantic love – the philosopher Bertrand Russell called it “one of the most exciting novels I have read”
 It was published in New York in 1897, two years after its completion, as its English publisher feared an adverse reaction – one reviewer denounced the book’s “outrageous and horrible character”
 A translation appeared the following year in Russia, where the tsarist authorities’ disapproval only enhanced its popularity

The Gadfly is set in Italy during the revolutionary ferment of the 1830s and ‘40s
 The protagonist is a young Englishman, Arthur Burton, who moves to a Catholic seminary after the death of his mother
 There he becomes devoted to his guardian and mentor Montanelli, who, unknown to him, is also his biological father
 In the company of his childhood sweetheart Gemma, Arthur becomes involved in the Young Italy movement fighting Austrian imperial rule
 But he unwittingly betrays his comrades, after his private confession is relayed to the police
 He then discovers his family secret, and loses all faith in the church
Arthur feigns his suicide and escapes to South America, where he endures years of torture and degradation
 He returns to Italy in the guise of ‘The Gadfly’, a fearless and revered revolutionary whose true identity is masked
 After his capture, he is visited by Montanelli, now a cardinal, who offers him a lifeline
 But Arthur, unforgiving and uncompromising, demands that his father renounce the church
 Montanelli refuses and condemns his son to death
 Arthur, now a Christ-like figure, commands his own execution and forgives the firing squad
 At the Corpus Christi mass, Montanelli denounces God’s sacrifice, then dies of a broken heart
Cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Valentina Tereshkova credited its influence
The novel gained popularity initially in Ireland with socialists and nationalists fighting for independence, and it remains the bestselling Irish novel of all time
 Yet it was in the newly-created Communist states of the Soviet Union and China that the book found its most dedicated readership
 Arthur, the embodiment of a Romantic tragic hero, was repeatedly voted Russia’s most popular literary figure, and cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Valentina Tereshkova, the first man and woman in space, credited its influence
Back in the USSR
In the 1930s, The Gadfly inspired another bestseller, Nikolai Ostrovsky’s How the Steel Was Tempered, which sold 35 million copies in the Soviet Union
 Ostrovsky’s socialist realist novel features a fearless young communist who suffers dreadfully for his sacrifices, but finds perpetual sustenance in the example of The Gadfly, which he reads to his fellow comrades
 Voynich’s novel was bolstered further by a 1955 Sovcolor film adaptation directed by Aleksandr Faintsimmer
 It sold 39 million tickets and featured Shostakovich’s score, which became celebrated in its own right as The Gadfly Suite
The Gadfly was popular in the early stages of China’s Cultural Revolution
The Gadfly found its largest audience in China – where Montanelli had been a missionary, and where suspicion of the Catholic Church was high
 According to Carma Hinton, director of the documentary Morning Sun, “the novel enjoyed an unrivalled place in the hearts and minds of the young participants in the Cultural Revolution”
 Arthur offers a “careful balance of sentiment with steely resolve” – he is a lover and a fighter, in the vein of the ‘knight-errant’ of traditional Chinese folklore

This passage of Voynich’s novel captures why the book was so popular in the early stages of China’s Cultural Revolution, with its veneration of youth and its anti-clerical celebration of iconoclasm:
“Padre, come away with us
 What have you to do with this dead world of priests and idols
 They are full of the dust of bygone ages; they are rotten; they are pestilent and foul
 Come out of this plague-stricken Church – come away with us into the light
 Padre, it is we that are life and youth; it is we that are the everlasting springtime; it is we that are the future
 Padre, the dawn is close upon us – will you miss your part in the sunrise
”
Yet as the Cultural Revolution progressed, and the cult of Mao deepened, the rebellious Gadfly was suppressed, for fear it would be turned against the father figure of modern China
 When the novel was re-released in the late 1970s, after Mao’s death, it resonated with those whose faith in China’s ‘Cardinal’ had waned
Fly in the ointment
The melodrama of Voynich’s novel is matched by the extraordinary story of her own life
 Ethel was born in Cork to parents George Boole, an eminent mathematician, and the philosopher Mary Everest, whose uncle gave his name to the world’s highest mountain
 At the age of 15, Ethel read about the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Mazzini
 She longed for his “melancholy beauty and distinction”, and until the day she married, dressed in black to “mourn the state of the world”
(Credit: Alamy)
By Voynich’s death in 1960 The Gadfly had sold 2
5m copies in the Soviet Union – and it remains popular today, popping up at Victory Day celebrations (Credit: Alamy)
In 1889, Ethel met, and later married, the Polish radical Wilfred Michał Voynich, who had escaped a prison camp in Siberia
 In London, she learned Russian from an émigré who had assassinated the head of the Tsar’s secret police, and with her husband travelled to Russia to aid the revolutionary cause
US politician Adlai Stevenson visited Moscow to arrange for payment of her long-overdue royalties
On returning to London, she met a true gadfly, Sidney Reilly, described by his autobiographer as “the greatest spy in history… who was said to possess eleven passports and a wife to go with each”
 Reilly and Voynich travelled to Italy, where he claims to have told Ethel his life story, elements of which bear striking similarities to the Gadfly
 Reilly, a British secret agent and a model for James Bond, then travelled to Russia, where he tried to assassinate Lenin and was killed in 1925
(Credit: Alamy)

Voynich never acknowledged Reilly’s role, and it remains a source of controversy, although she confirmed that the character of Gemma was drawn from the life of Charlotte Wilson, mistress of the anarchist Prince Peter Kropotkin
 Gemma is perhaps Voynich’s most enduring legacy: “one of the most impressive attempts to present an emancipated woman”, wrote the critic Arnold Kettle
Voynich’s life story has a strange final twist
 In 1955, a Soviet delegation of writers learned that the author, long presumed dead, was alive in New York – the newspaper Pravda proclaimed her resurrection, much like that of her protagonist
 Ethel had been living in obscurity, and due to Soviet copyright laws, she was unaware of her legendary status in Russia
 The following year, Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson visited Moscow to arrange for payment of her long-overdue royalties
 When Ethel died in 1960, she was mourned in Russia as a national hero
In 2011, Chinese-born writer Yiyun Li visited Cork, and requested to pay homage at the birthplace of Ethel Voynich
 In the UK, The Gadfly remains out of print and almost unknown, yet around the world readers and writers still revere its author, just as DH Lawrence, Rebecca West and Friedrich Engels once did
 With its rich religious imagery and stirring revolutionary themes, The Gadfly has an abiding appeal for lovers of historical fiction, and deserves to be rediscovered in its original language
This year marks the 50th anniversary of one of the great cultural moments of the last century, the ‘Summer of Love’
 It will be commemorated as a season of celebration, but it was triggered by a protest event: the Human Be-In at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco in January 1967, organised in opposition to the prohibition of LSD
 State and federal governments argued that the psychedelic drug, also known as acid, threatened the fabric of US life, and they were right – LSD made neither good consumers nor loyal citizens in a time of war
 Their adversary was a group of lawless evangelists who had formed a church in devotion to the drug’s transformative power: the Brotherhood of Eternal Love

The Brotherhood had a template for utopia
 It was to be found in the final novel, Island, of the grand philosopher of psychedelics, Aldous Huxley
 A prominent advocate for the use of psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, Huxley was a founding member of a pioneering Harvard project led by Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert
 Leary and Alpert supervised the Good Friday Experiment at Marsh Chapel in Boston in April 1962, which found that psilocybin profoundly affected the religious experience of nine out of the 10 graduate students
Huxley’s imagined society is pacifist, cerebral, sexually experimental, spiritual yet anti-clerical
Island had inspired Leary and Alpert to launch the Zihuatanejo Project, a psychedelic training centre under the umbrella of their International Federation for Internal Freedom
 The community was located on the coast of south-west Mexico, and it was here that they began writing The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead
 The book was dedicated to Huxley and cites his 1954 essay The Doors of Perception, which explored the hallucinogenic effects of mescaline, a psychedelic substance found in plants indigenous to Mexico
 As the Tibetan Book of the Dead had prepared monks for mortality and reincarnation, so The Psychedelic Experience would teach them how to handle the experience of ‘ego death’ and rebirth
Island life
Island is a utopian counterpoint to Huxley’s dystopian novel Brave New World
 It takes place on a fictional island called Pala, named after a town near Mount Palomar in southern California, where Huxley’s friend Edwin Hubble watched the skies and where members of the Brotherhood took acid
 The inhabitants of Pala are enriched by their experiences with psychedelic mushrooms, and they create a society that reflects Huxley’s ideals: pacifist, cerebral, sexually experimental, spiritual yet anti-clerical
 The novel is a celebration of living in the moment, and, unlike in Brave New World, drugs are a source of enlightenment and compassion rather than pacification
Huxley requested a high dosage of LSD in his final hours
The year before publication, Huxley’s home in Los Angeles had been destroyed in a fire that left him, in his own words, “a man without possessions and without a past”
 He had been diagnosed with laryngeal cancer, and a key theme in the novel is coming to terms with death, which the islanders do with equanimity
 Famously, Huxley requested a high dosage of LSD in his final hours – his wife, who administered the injections, described it as “the most serene, most beautiful death”

 It had a huge impact on the Brotherhood of Eternal Love (Credit: Alamy)
The drug had a similarly profound effect on the petty criminals who would become the Brotherhood, two-thirds of whom had already had run-ins with the law
 Their founder, John Griggs, was high on heroin when he robbed a Hollywood producer at gunpoint – but after taking LSD for the first time, he renounced violence, apologised and returned the stolen goods
 This transformation is not as strange as it may seem: a research experiment in 1962 by Leary’s Harvard Psilocybin Project suggested that recidivism rates could be cut drastically by treating prisoners with psychedelics
The King of Tonga was even asked to provide the Brotherhood with a home
Initially, the Brotherhood’s aim had been to ‘drop out’ of society and start anew on an island paradise
 “To us, the island represented freedom”, says Edward Padilla, an early member of the group
 Many of the Brotherhood favoured settling in Hawaii, while a friend of Padilla flew to the remote Pacific island of Micronesia to scout out territory
 The British researcher Michael Hollingshead, who first introduced Leary to LSD at the recommendation of Huxley, even spoke to the King of Tonga about providing the Brotherhood with a home
Acid tabs

It was agreed that the Brotherhood would thrive only if they could survive in isolation, and so they began to experiment in communal self-sufficiency
 At Modjeska Canyon in Orange County, the group grew their own crops, wove their own clothes, built their own houses, and even learnt how to deliver babies
 “Instead of dropping out of society, they created their own version of it”, says Nicholas Schou, author of a book on the Brotherhood
 But they were forced to abandon the settlement after it burned down due to a fire at their makeshift church
Oh, Brother
Religion was central to the Brotherhood: they referred to themselves as the ‘disciples’, and believed that LSD could ‘heal and reveal’
 Schou notes that the group regarded acid as “a sacrament, a window into God itself, a key to unlock ‘the doors of perception’”
 Robert Ackerly, who represented the Brotherhood in San Francisco’s hippy Haight-Ashbury district, “felt we were doing God’s work”
 A practical reason for registering as a church was to seek religious exemption from prohibition – a strategy pursued by Leary’s own League of Spiritual Discovery
Acid was taken in such quantities that the Hells’ Angels were asked to run the crèche
In protesting the prohibition, the Human Be-In was fuelled by LSD – acid was taken in such quantities that the Hells’ Angels were asked to run the crèche
 Up to 30,000 people heard Leary make a speech in which coined the slogan “Turn on, tune in, drop out”
 The Be-In featured poetry from Allen Ginsberg and music from Jefferson Airplane and The Grateful Dead, and inspired a series of imitation events (Love-In, Bed-In)
Timothy Leary

The Brotherhood began to distribute – often for free – their own brand of LSD called Orange Sunshine, with funds raised from the smuggling of Afghan hashish, which they brought directly from Kabul and Kandahar, via Karachi, Istanbul, Frankfurt and London
 It was an audacious global smuggling operation, with drugs stashed in musical instruments, in a VW camper van, and, in quintessentially Californian style, inside hollowed-out surfboards
 Communion with the waves was a core part of the Brotherhood’s spiritual identity – they referred to it as ‘Christ in the Curl’
Hard comedown
The Brotherhood’s religious inspirations were diverse, from the I Ching to Leary’s Psychedelic Prayers, and strongly favoured the eastern concepts practiced by the islanders of Huxley’s Pala
 In Laguna Beach, the group opened a ‘psychedelic emporium’ called Mystic Arts World, in which all the corners were rounded, as stipulated by the Book of Tao
 It was in front of this shop that Leary launched his ill-fated bid to be governor of California against Ronald Reagan in 1969, for which John Lennon wrote the campaign song Come Together

Seeking privacy, some of the Brotherhood moved inland to a ranch near Idyllwild, to create a couples-only commune led by Leary, who declared that he and Griggs were ‘agents of God’, born to lead ‘a new breed’
 Then, at the age of 25, Griggs died of an overdose of psilocybin crystals
 The Brotherhood responded by redoubling their commitment, and expanded their operations to produce 10kg of LSD – approximately 100 million doses
 According to Michael Randall, a formative member of the Brotherhood, the plan was to drive down the price of LSD through mass production – to distribute “so much Orange Sunshine that it would become virtually free
 We had a deep spiritual commitment to what we were doing”
They dropped 25,000 tabs of acid from a plane onto revellers on the beach below
Brotherhood members, christened the ‘Hippie Mafia’ by the police, used multiple identities to evade detection, but remained socially and politically influential
 In 1970, after helping Leary escape a Californian jail, the Brotherhood gave $25,000 to the Black Panthers, who in turn passed it on to the radical left-wing group, the Weather Underground, to smuggle Leary to Algeria and then to Afghanistan
 During a three-day ‘happening’ in Laguna Beach – a riotous birthday party for Jesus Christ that began on Christmas Day, 1970 – the Brotherhood dropped 25,000 tabs of acid from a plane onto revellers, in a concerted attempt at communal spiritual revolution

The group’s celebrity also inspired one of the strangest films ever made, Rainbow Bridge (1972)
 It features Jimi Hendrix’s final recorded US performance, given exclusively to the Brotherhood at the top of a volcano in Maui, Hawaii
 The movie glamourised the group’s activities, which included creating a strain of cannabis called Maui Wowie, but it also revealed their surfboard ruse, to the dismay of some Brotherhood members
 The film is a distinctly hippie creation (“Let’s make love…You can’t make love – love is
”), but it was not well-received: one critic described the film as “a ludicrous farrago of pseudo-mystical acid babble devoid of sincerity… the best thing that can be said about Rainbow Bridge is that, after seventy-one minutes, it finishes”
They’re a bunch of loose cannons on a ship of fools – Owsley Stanley
Not everyone viewed the Brotherhood’s activities as a form of emancipation
 In his final annual address to Congress in 1968, President Lyndon Johnson denounced drug distribution, saying “The time has come to stop the sale of slavery to the young”
 Owsley Stanley, who made LSD into tablet form for the acid tests of writer Ken Kesey, described the Brotherhood as “loose cannons on a ship of fools”
 Richard Alpert, who renamed himself Ram Dass (‘servant of God’) after meeting his guru in India, was wary of the group’s ambition: “They were rebellious and wanted to use psychedelics to challenge the government
 They had the tiger by the tail”
By contrast, Leary believed he was a modern messiah, describing himself as "the wisest man of the 20th Century"
 He became a divisive figure within the Brotherhood itself, in part because he didn’t share the vision of a surf-rich island utopia
 Ultimately, it was Nixon’s war on drugs that undid the Brotherhood, along with the increasing popularity of an alternative ‘unspiritual’ narcotic: cocaine
Fifty years after the Summer of Love, psychedelics are attracting the attention of the group they first inspired – medical researchers
 In the novel Island, a character experiences a ‘good’ death after taking psychedelics, just as Huxley did
 Projects at New York University and John Hopkins University are now exploring the effects of psilocybin in palliative care for cancer patients
 Huxley’s vision, which has lain dormant for half a century, may yet come to fruition
Some people yearn to stand out; others try desperately to blend in
 A rare few individuals manage to do both at the same time
 Sam Barsky is one of those
 Since last weekend, the previously little-known knitter from Maryland has found himself suddenly in the headlines for his ability to stitch himself, quite literally, into his surroundings
 Photos of Barsky wearing jumpers he has designed that feature the very location in which he’s standing – from Stonehenge to Niagara Falls, from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California, to London’s Tower Bridge – have gone viral this week
(Credit: Sam Barsky)

Barsky’s compulsion to weave himself into the very fabric of his environment dates back to 1999 and a transitional moment in his life when, for health reasons, he abandoned plans to become a nurse
 Encouraged by staff at a local yarn shop, Barsky soon elevated a mere restorative hobby into a fresh creative medium all his own
 Soon, he was collecting photos of himself, now standing at an aquarium while sporting a knitted slither of anemones, now posing among a blush of blossoming cherry trees that appear to have spun themselves from the orchard we see stitched onto his chest
For all its quirky originality, however, Barsky’s curious sartorial art is deeply in accord not only with broader artistic themes of the age but with some of the most powerful instincts in all of art history
 As a serial self-portraitist who blurs his being into the world around him, Barksy possesses imaginative urges that might be compared with those of the American photographer Cindy Sherman (best known for countless likenesses of herself disguised in historical and filmic costume) and with those of the contemporary sculptor Antony Gormley, who has installed innumerable cast-iron replicas of his own body in many urban and rural locations across Britain
For an even more intriguing parallel with Barsky’s aesthetic intuitions, one must summon that most celebrated selfieist of all – the 17th-Century Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn
 Creator of more than 80 images of his own countenance over the course of his life, Rembrandt chronicled not only the slow ripening of his face over five decades (from the 1620s to the 1660s), but also his preoccupation with seeing himself as part of the rich tapestry of cultural history
(Credit: Wikimedia)
Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn painted himself in different costumes, as in Self-portrait in Oriental Attire With Poodle (1631) (Credit: Wikimedia)
Likewise obsessed with the texture of textiles, Rembrandt was an incorrigible chameleon who wove his paint into luxurious disguise: from the opulence of oriental dress in one lavish painting from the 1630s, to the humbleness of apostolic garb in his vision of himself as St Paul in the last decade of his life
 For Rembrandt, as for Barsky, art became a kind of second skin, a camouflage that made him feel more naturally at one with the universe around him
One day in June 1906, Pablo Picasso arrived in the ancient Catalan village of Gosol, high in the Pyrenees
 A friend had tipped him off about this “magnificent” mountain refuge, which was notorious for its smugglers
 Intrigued, he had persuaded his mistress, the chic, auburn-haired former artist’s model Fernande Olivier, who had a penchant for French perfume, to go with him on the arduous journey to Gosol from Barcelona, where they had spent a happy couple of weeks catching up with Picasso’s old friends after travelling to the city by train from Paris
Gosol

The alarming final approach to Gosol had to be undertaken on mules, which picked their way up precarious mountain tracks beside terrifying precipices
 Upon arriving, Picasso and Olivier took a room on the first floor of the village’s only inn, the Hostal cal Tampanada
 The plan was to while away the summer painting and enjoying the pleasures of a simple life
In self-imposed exile from the backbiting Parisian art world, Picasso changed his art dramatically
Art historians ascribe special importance to Picasso’s time in Gosol, because there, in self-imposed exile from the backbiting Parisian art world, he changed his art dramatically and profoundly
By 1906, Picasso had already enjoyed a taste of success in Paris, the epicentre of the avant-garde at that time
 His 1901 debut Paris exhibition at the gallery of the dealer Ambroise Vollard had received positive reviews
 Moreover, in the American collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein, he had found two important champions
 But his melancholic and sentimental Blue and Rose period paintings, as brilliant as they were, were still indebted to 19th-Century art movements such as Symbolism
Avignon 
Picasso persuaded his mistress, Fernande Olivier, who featured in many of his paintings including les Demoiselles d’Avignon, to go with him (Credit: Wikipedia)
When he arrived in Gosol, though, Picasso’s art was moving in a new, startling, and more original direction
 It was beginning to feel tougher and simpler, stranger yet more timeless
 Picasso sensed this change, and revelled in the rapture of inspiration
 During his stay in Gosol, which lasted around 10 weeks, he was remarkably prolific: according to his biographer, John Richardson, he produced seven large paintings, a dozen medium-sized ones, and countless drawings, watercolours, gouaches, and carvings
Skulls and smugglers
What was the catalyst for this transformation and excitement
 There are several possibilities
 Many of Picasso’s Gosol works feature Olivier, for instance, suggesting that the 24-year-old artist’s feelings for his lover were then especially intense
Pipe

There was also his new friendship with Gosol’s wily nonagenarian innkeeper, Josep Fondevila, a former smuggler with a shaved head and brilliant white teeth whom Picasso greatly admired
 Certainly, Fontdevila’s severe, ascetic appearance began to infiltrate Picasso’s art, and it remained a touchstone until his death (witness the late skull-like self-portrait that the artist drew in 1972)
But Picasso also encountered something else in Gosol that altered his approach to painting: a 12th-Century polychrome wooden Madonna, with a strong, expressive white face with big, painted eyes, which he saw in the village church

Today, this 77cm-high (30in) sculpture, which is considered a fine example of Catalan Romanesque art, is part of the collection of Barcelona’s Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC)
 It currently plays a starring role in MNAC’s Romanesque Picasso, a show featuring around 40 artworks by the Spanish Modernist
 This exhibition suggests “affinities” between Picasso’s work and the holdings of medieval Romanesque art, mostly from churches in the Pyrenees built during the 11th to 13th centuries, for which MNAC is internationally renowned
 One glance at the Gosol Madonna, for instance, reveals that it was a source for Picasso’s painting Woman with Loaves (1906)
The thing is, while art historians are aware that Picasso was looking with interest at Romanesque art in the years leading up to his invention of Cubism, they tend to overlook its impact upon his development, preferring instead to concentrate on better-known influences such as African tribal art, archaic Iberian sculpture, and Cezanne
Crucifixion

“While Picasso’s ‘primitivism’ has always been known,” says MNAC’s director Pepe Serra, “what is clear upon seeing the show is that Romanesque art was also one of the most important sources for him
 The exhibition demonstrates that there is a very strong connection between Picasso and Romanesque art
”
‘Creative lifeblood’
It is likely that Picasso first started looking seriously at Romanesque art four years prior to his trip to Gosol, when a major exhibition of Romanesque and Gothic art opened in Barcelona, coinciding with a resurgence in Catalan nationalism
 A little over three decades later, in 1934, by which time Picasso was an international celebrity living permanently in France, the artist returned to Barcelona to visit the new National Museum (then known as the Art Museum of Catalonia), shortly before its official inauguration
A newspaper covered the event, which proved to be Picasso’s last visit to his homeland  – after the rise of Franco, he never returned to Spain
 “Passing from one room to another,” the reporter wrote, “Picasso, before those incomparable fragments of early Catalan art, admired [their] power, intensity and skill … and he stated without hesitation that our Romanesque Museum will be something unique in the world, an indispensable resource for anyone who wishes to know the origins of Western art, an invaluable lesson for the moderns
”
When asked how much Romanesque art meant to him, Miró used to tap the veins in his forearm
Throughout his life, as MNAC’s exhibition reveals, Picasso amassed many books, postcards and photographs documenting Romanesque art, attesting to his enduring interest in the subject
 In this, he was not alone
 Joan Miró, for instance, another great modern Spanish artist, was also compelled by Romanesque art, which he studied as a boy growing up in Barcelona
 When asked how much it meant to him, Miró used to tap the veins in his forearm
 It was in his creative lifeblood
Skull 
Skulls, crucifixions and a focus on death are all common in Catalan Romanesque art (Credit: Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya)
What, then, was the “invaluable lesson” that Romanesque art taught both Picasso and Miró
 According to MNAC’s director, Picasso was drawn to the “simplicity” of Catalan Romanesque art: “It’s a naive, very ‘primitive’ art,” Serra explains
 “For example, perspective is not used, and it is extremely schematic in the composition of the faces, which appealed to Picasso
 It is also full of symbols – eyes, fires, fish – that represent other things
”
“And there is another big link with Picasso in terms of the subjects: the violence, the dismembered bodies, the skulls, crucifixions, the presence of death
 So, there are thematic links as well as stylistic ones
”
Elizabeth Cowling, emeritus professor of art history at the University of Edinburgh and curator of Picasso Portraits, an ongoing exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London, agrees: the aspects of Romanesque art that most appealed to Picasso, she says, were “the stylisation, the intensity and forcefulness, the fact that it wasn’t driven by a naturalist aesthetic”

Like Serra, she believes that Picasso’s stay in Gosol in 1906 was “very important”, because it was “the break that gave him the opportunity to absorb sources he’d recently discovered more fully and develop ideas and themes outside the competitive environment of a major city
 And being such a backwater – so unmodernised – it must have reinforced his well-established penchant for the primitive
”
Indeed, Picasso’s wider interest in primitivism helps to explain his fascination with Romanesque art
 “Primitivism is a huge subject,” says Cowling
 “But, very broadly, primitivists had a sense that the ‘primitive’ was more authentic and purer than sophisticated Western art of the Renaissance and post-Renaissance periods
 There’s a strong element of anti-naturalism at its core, and also anti-academicism – so anything that was considered ‘canonical’ at the time was liable to be rejected by primitivists
”
In other words, the Romanesque offered Picasso a revelatory model as he battled to dismantle and reassemble the great tradition of Western art
 As Cowling puts it: “Picasso was never passive when it came to sources of inspiration – he got excited by new discoveries, but I think he was attracted to a new source because it chimed with something that already interested him, that meant something for his current work

The five members of the band took the lift to the 12th Floor of the Victor Talking Machine Company’s building on 38th Street in New York City
 They were known for playing while wearing white shirts with top collars buttoned and no neckties but black dinner jackets with shiny lapels
 The song this quintet would play for the waiting microphones was silly, and not rendered with the greatest of technical skill – its most memorable moment is when a clarinet imitates the sound of a rooster; a cornet, a whinnying horse; and a trombone, a cow
 The Beatles playing Ed Sullivan this was not
 And yet this was as significant a moment in US musical history
 The date was 26 February 1917, and this novelty song, Livery Stable Blues by the Original Dixieland Jass Band, was the first jazz recording

That would be a remarkable milestone in its own right, but embedded into Livery Stable Blues are issues that have haunted jazz, and popular music as a whole, ever since
 We all know the debates, from Elvis to Taylor Swift, over white copycats appropriating the sound and style of black musicians
 When they recorded Livery Stable Blues the all-white Original Dixieland Jass Band borrowed to the point of plagiarism from the African-American musicians they’d heard in their native New Orleans
 We follow the legal challenges over who wrote Stairway to Heaven or whether Blurred Lines should have listed Marvin Gaye as a co-author
 Livery Stable Blues, one of the first true hit singles, selling over one million copies at a time most still preferred to buy sheet music over recordings, inspired its own attribution battle
 We’ve all heard the arguments, usually from very concerned parents, about what defines good taste or aesthetic achievement in popular music
 The judge who presided over the lawsuit about who wrote Livery Stable Blues ultimately ruled that since the song was in bad taste and composed by people who couldn’t actually read or write sheet music it would be remanded to the “public domain” with no writer attributed at all
It was spelled 'J-A-S-S
' That was dirty, and if you knew what it was, you wouldn't say it in front of ladies – Eubie Blake
More than other forms of popular music Jazz is particularly fraught with these kind of debates, but some of the most heated arguments among jazz aficionados are even more fundamental: what qualifies as jazz
 Does jazz have some essential ingredient
 Where does the term “jazz” even come from
 One hundred years after the first jazz recording, the answers remain elusive, but the story of Livery Stable Blues shows how early the questions that still surround the genre were raised
Word play
‘Jazz’ was named the Word of the 20th Century by the American Dialect Society, which is remarkable since we don’t actually know for sure from where the term originates
 One of the most striking features of jazz to its earliest listeners was its speed, its sheer energy
 Dating back to 1860 there had been an African-American slang term, ‘jasm’, which means ‘vim’ or ‘energy’
  On 14 November 1916, the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper referred for the first time to “jas bands”
  That particular spelling suggests “jas” could have come from jasm
 Or perhaps it referred to the jasmine perfume that prostitutes in New Orleans’ famed Storyville red light district often wore – jazz music had developed, in part, as the music played in brothels
 Early jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton, whose own name was a euphemism for sex, first developed his own style playing piano in these ‘sporting houses’ and to get extra tips he’d peek at a prostitute and her client through a peephole and time his playing with the pace of their revels

The Original Dixieland Jass Band itself shows the etymological mystery of jazz
 Like ‘jas’, ‘jass’ probably has a sexual connotation, as a reference to a woman’s backside
 Musician Eubie Blake said, in an interview with National Public Radio before his death in 1983: “When Broadway picked it up, they called it 'J-A-Z-Z
’ It wasn't called that
 It was spelled 'J-A-S-S
' That was dirty, and if you knew what it was, you wouldn't say it in front of ladies
" Or perhaps by the time ‘jass’ made it to New York City from New Orleans, bandleaders were simply tired of pranksters scratching off the ‘j’ from their posters
 A few months after that recording of Livery Stable Blues, the fivesome would change their name to the Original Dixieland Jazz Band for good

Livery Stable Blues also helps answer the question ‘What is jazz
’ by pointing to its roots
 The song is structured around three chords and into 12 bars, like virtually all blues songs emerging from the African-American tradition
 Its barnyard sounds connect it to the setting of the work songs black field labourers would sing
 Its habanera beat, common to so much of jazz, reflects the influence of bouncy Caribbean melodies on New Orleans music – there were several ferries arriving in New Orleans from Havana every day in the early 20th Century
 Its repetition indicates the call-and-response tradition of black Baptist churches
 The clarinet, cornet and trombone in its arrangement reflect the influence of march music, which was wildly popular in New Orleans during and after the Civil War and resulted in an excess of brass and woodwind instruments floating around the city for would-be musicians to play
 Its piano comes from the tradition of ragtime, the musical form that directly proceeded jazz
 And its sense of humour comes from minstrelsy, the tradition of parodying opera and operettas and poking fun, often most insensitively, at the racial divide between white and black
 Minstrelsy most commonly featured white musicians in blackface projecting their own cartoonish idea of what it meant to be black – and it was by far the most popular form of music in the US from 1840 to 1920
 But while minstrelsy involved white Americans parodying their idea of African-Americans, many other white musicians like those of the Original Dixieland Jass Band chose to copy African-American musical traditions wholesale
The musical DNA in Livery Stable Blues comes from black artists and shows that jazz is a fundamentally African-American music, even if an all-white band was first to record it
 The particular mix of African-style drumbeats and the Caribbean rhythm, found in this song but so common to jazz as a whole, points to the time from 1817 to 1843, when black slaves – some from Africa, some from the Caribbean, some from the interior of the American South – would gather on Sundays in New Orleans’ Congo Square to play music and cross-pollinate their traditions
 New Orleans Creoles of colour, who were the mixed-race descendants of black and white ancestors, typically identified more with European culture than with Africa’s
 After the Jim Crow laws of 1890 classified the city’s mixed-race Creoles as ‘black’, they were only allowed to play with other black musicians and this brought a greater musical fluency and technical skill to black music because many Creoles of colour were trained in classical music
 Jazz emerged from this merger of forms
Full circle
But as to who actually invented jazz, if such an achievement could be attributed to one person, that’s a tricky matter
 Some say Elvis Presley or Chuck Berry invented rock n’ roll, others would argue DJ Kool Herc or Grandmaster Flash created hip hop
 Nick La Rocca, the Original Dixieland Jass Band’s cornet player and composer, claimed that he personally invented jazz – though the cornetist Buddy Bolden had a much better claim, or even the Creole artist Morton, who certainly was the first to write jazz out as sheet music and always said he’d invented it
 As jazz historian Gary Giddins puts it, “LaRocca turned racist, and proceeded to make horrible statements about how whites invented jazz, and how they were there before the black guys, and so forth, scurrilous stuff — a cartoon cliché of the Southern bigot
” Louis Armstrong was more charitable in his 1936 book Swing That Music, calling the Original Dixieland Jass Band “the first great jazz orchestra” and that LaRocca “had an instrumentation different from anything before, an instrumentation that made the old songs sound new
” But LaRocca’s later statements follow a long tradition in the US of white artists dependent on African-American culture publicly degrading it in order to justify their exploitation of it

It’s not only the racism and the cultural appropriation that makes even Dixieland jazz aficionados uncomfortable with the Original Dixieland Jass Band – it’s the bad taste of it all too: LaRocca’s inflammatory comments, yes, but also the silliness of the animal sounds the musicians imitate in their performances, their lack of technical proficiency, the association of their sound with minstrelsy
 But the loudest voices who declare ‘this is not jazz’ about any particular band or sound are usually jazz obsessives splitting musical hairs that only the infatuated would care about
 It’s an internal civil war
(Credit: Christie’s)
Henri Matisse produced an entire volume of his famous cutouts, accompanied by his own poetic, written thoughts, dedicated to jazz in 1947 (Credit: Christie’s)
Jazz as a whole also came under attack as an example of bad taste, however, in much the same way rock n’ roll and hip-hop would later, by people who had no knowledge of the music whatsoever
 The New York Times published editorial after editorial throughout the late 1910s and 1920s touting the dangers of jazz, which had historically been associated with the brothels where it was initially played; just months after Livery Stable Blues became a hit recording, the Storyville red light district, previous tolerated by the city leaders of New Orleans, was completely shut down
 And Edward Baxter Perry wrote in the popular music magazine The Etude that ragtime, into which he was lumping early jazz songs like Livery Stable Blues and the Original Dixieland Jass Band’s even more popular 1917 follow-up Tiger Rag, “is syncopation gone mad
 And its victims in my opinion can only be treated like the dog with rabies, with a dose of lead
 Whether it is simply a passing phase in our decadent art culture, or an infectious disease which has come to say, like leprosy, time will tell
”
These attacks on jazz from both outsiders and insiders still occur today
 Even the film La La Land taps into this, with Emma Stone’s jazz neophyte Mia declaring “I hate jazz” while Ryan Gosling’s jazz pianist Seb frets endlessly about what is and isn’t jazz and whether the form has a future – “it’s conflict and it’s compromise, it’s new every time, and it’s dying
”
Over the 100-year journey from Livery Stable Blues to La La Land the music has changed drastically, while the discourse has remained the same
 Perhaps it’s time to stop talking and start listening
Shams-ud-din Muhammad Hafiz (c
 1320-1389) is one of the most beloved poets of the Persians, and is considered by many – from different cultures – to be one of the seven literary wonders of the world
 Ralph Waldo Emerson and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe both agreed
 As Emerson said of Hafiz: "He fears nothing
 He sees too far, he sees throughout; such is the only man I wish to see or be
" And Emerson gave Hafiz that grand and famous compliment, "Hafiz is a poet for poets
"
Hafiz has no peer – Goethe
Both Goethe and Emerson translated Hafiz
 And after Geothe's deep study of him, simply – though remarkably – stated, "Hafiz has no peer
"
Hafiz poems were also admired by such diverse notables as Nietzsche and Arthur Conan Doyle, whose wonderful character Sherlock Holmes quotes Hafiz
 Garcia Lorca praised the Sufi poet
 Johannes Brahms was so touched by his verse he used several in his compositions
 And even Queen Victoria was said to have consulted Hafiz in times of need – which has been a custom in the Middle East for centuries
  The Fal-e Hafiz, is an ancient tradition in which a reader asks Hafiz for advice when facing a difficulty or at an important juncture in their life – treating his books as an oracle and opening them with a deep wish from their soul for guidance
Hafiz

The range of Hafiz is indeed stunning and provocative at times:
I am a hole in a flute that the Christ's breath
moves through – listen to this music
Then this, from another poem,
Look at the smile on the Earth's lips this
morning, she laid again with me last night
I feel Hafiz is a rare master of  ‘the utility of light’ – or ‘the sun’
 And ‘the utility of art’
 His poetry bestows its benevolence and ability to comfort, enliven and enrich those in need
 Art should be a lover; it should radiate and allow you to warm yourself if in any way cold
 Art can quench inner thirst and hunger
  And in studying the lives – and working with the poetry – of Rumi, Michelangelo, St Francis, Kabir, Mira and Hafiz, and several of the other great poet-seers, East and West, I came to learn that there was a wonderful common denominator in their work
 They helped me form a three-word definition of art, which I then felt was a true gauge for success of any of poems or writings I ever become involved with, including my own
 As Emerson saw Hafiz as a genuine measure of himself in all of his interactions, I too try to keep Hafiz before me when dealing with another person – or animal, creature or even plant
 As water is poured through a cloth to collect impurities, I try and pour myself through the poems of Hafiz, and my images of him
In the moment
Those three words that Hafiz exemplifies, that came to me in studying the lives and works of those greats I just mentioned are an important definition and goal of art, and a standard I hold myself to: engage and give

Perhaps one of the greatest attributes and values of art is to capture and exploit another person's attention
 For when beauty does that the witness, or audience, always benefits
 As Hafiz says:
The mountain's face lifted me higher than
itself
A song's wink aligned me with joy
 And a
tune paradise hums I came to know
The forest, letting me walk amongst its naked
limbs, had me on my knees again in silence
shouting – yes, yes my holy friend, let your
splendour devour me
To be engaged by a true teacher like Hafiz is to have lasting ingredients put into your mind, that when cooked through contemplation help us lead a better life
 Inherent in engaging someone's interest is to make them present
 And with so many suffering the tyranny of some past event or anxieties about the future, what a gift being in the moment can be, especially then if a jewel can be slipped into your pocket by some magi'sbrush stroke, writings, sculpture, instrument, or ballet step
 Hafiz helps us inherit a treasure that is already ours, decreed at birth; and he speaks directly about that in some of his poems – how to file your claim
‘Wine-tasting of the sky’
I have published around 700 Hafiz rendering-poems in six books
 And the impetus behind every single line of Hafiz I ever wrote is to help light a candle in your heart, to assist our perennial need to have fun, laugh and dance, "to lift the corners of your mouth
" The weight that can be on us in an hour or a day, Hafiz is there to lighten
  His love for us is time tested and keeps encouraging and can inspire
 He helps us to forgive those we have yet to forgive
 And honour those we have yet to honour
 And his herculean strength, his enlightenment, will rub off on you so that you too wish (and discover yourself more able) never to harm another via sound or movement
 Hafiz became incapable of an unkind act, it is said
Hafiz longs to help the highest aspects in us lead all the other parts
In hundreds of ways Hafiz addresses what impedes us from living a more fulfilled life
 With unique, charming metaphors that he seems able to rain from the ground up, he longs to help the highest aspects in us lead all the other parts to a place where we can breathe easier and kick back more and say: "Ahhhh, this world isn’t so bad, as a matter of fact – it is amazing
" 
Tomb of Hafiz in Shiraz, Iran

Hafiz says:               
If your knees have not buckled in ecstasy while standing
when a veil parts
If a cherished tear of gratitude has not sung leaping from
your eye
If anything your palm does touch cannot help reveal the
Beloved
My words are full of golden secrets that are not too hard
to crack, and will remedy one hundred fears and ills
So, so many of Hafiz’s poems are precisely about unfettering the senses and refining the will, so that we do more “wine-tasting of the sky”, and more tenderly holding – in thought or with arms – the things we most love and know as precious nourishment
 He unsnares our “emerald wings”
Tales of the master
Two stories of Hafiz come to mind that my own teacher told me, and here again, these show the great range of Hafiz, and to me his rather incredible ability to never bore
 To constantly engage and give
 And so creatively lead
The first story goes:
Once a young woman came to Hafiz and said,
"What is the sign of someone knowing God
"
And Hafiz became very quiet, and stood in silence
for nearly a minute
 lovingly looking deep into the
young woman's eye, then softly spoke,
"My dear, they have dropped the knife
 The person
who knows God has dropped the cruel knife most
so often use upon their tender self – and others
"
The second story echoes a sensuousness, that is so much a part of the human dynamic, and that Hafiz fully embraces, and often uses as a springboard to heaven – as the body and its desires can be
 It goes:
A rather serious – maybe too serious – university
student from another country came to Hafiz to
personally ask for his permission to translate some
of Hafiz's poems into a little book
And he said to Hafiz, "What is the essential
quality in your poems that I need to incorporate in
my translations to make them abiding and authentic
"
And Hafiz smiled, and placed his arms on the man's
shoulders, then said, "Do you really want to know
"
And the young man said, "Of course
"
"Well, well then," Hafiz began and continued,
"My poems lift the corners of the mouth – the soul's
mouth, the heart's mouth
 And can effect any opening
that can make love
"
Like the wondrous life the sun and earth give in their miraculous utility, so can the artist sometimes share in that,and any human being who is full of buoyant passion – or willing to die for some great cause, or sublime ideals
So can the mind that knows all forms are part of an ultimate Self, and treats everything with respect
 And a sacred hand reaches out from Hafiz's profound compassion and wisdom
 A gentle embrace is there from his perhaps omnipresent spirit
 The mosaic of illumined consciousness in his poems lead us to a greater self-awareness, empowerment and freedom
 His wild onslaught of playful genius is a gold mine
 And a beautiful romance can begin with all who hold dearly his books
Daniel Ladinsky is a poet and interpreter of mystical poetry who has written several books about Hafiz
 His latest book Darling I Love You: Poems from the Hearts of Our Glorious Mutts and All Our Animal Friends is published by Penguin
It is one of life’s smouldering ironies that smoking tobacco damages the body while holding a pipe sharpens the mind
 “The pipe,” the British novelist William Makepeace Thackeray once wrote, “draws wisdom from the lips of the philosopher and shuts up the mouths of the foolish; it generates a style of conversation contemplative, thoughtful, benevolent, and unaffected
” Nor was Thackeray alone in thinking so
 Albert Einstein insisted pipes were instrumental in teasing out “calm and objective judgement in all human affairs”, while Arthur Conan Doyle’s literary invention, Sherlock Holmes, famously measured out the complexity of crime in pinches and puffs: “it is quite a three-pipe problem”
Curved quizzically into question marks, pipes are the very shape of thought
 They are as temperamentally transformative as they are physically compromising
 If a writer or artist wants to interject an air of meditation into a scene, the interposition of a pipe is the shortest of shorthands for doing so
 The Dutch Old Masters made great use of the pipe smoker, and later artists such as Paul Cézanne and James McNeill Whistler would recast him as an allegory of life’s slow exhalation into air
 (Vincent van Gogh auditioned himself several times in the role of the pipe-wielding contemplative
)

When the Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte wanted us to reflect on the inherent disconnection between representations of reality and reality itself, he did not scrawl across his provocative canvas The Treachery of Images (1928-29) “this is not a glass”, “
 or a tree”, “
 or a chair”, but rather “Ceci n'est pas une pipe”: “this is not a pipe”
As a prop, the pipe has slowly sculpted itself since its earliest appearances in Dutch Golden Age painting of the 17th Century into something intensely philosophical – a cue to the eyes that the scene they behold is an allegory to muse upon: a meditation on life, not life itself
 Until now
 An extraordinary photo, taken by the AFP’s Joseph Eid in the battle-ravaged Syrian city of Aleppo, has forced us to rethink the cultural cliché of the pensive pipe as mere metaphor
 Shot in the ruined, bomb-rattled home of Mohammed Mohiedin Anis (also known as Abu Omar), a 70-year old collector of vintage cars, the image is a mute dirge to the savage devastations of war
(Credit: Joseph Eid/AFP)

Sitting on the edge of his bed with his legs crossed as he listens to music on a record player, Abu Omar seems at first glance a caricature of art historical introspection – a composite of countless portraits of a nostalgic subject cradling the smooth stummel of his parabolic pipe
 But the scene of utter destruction in which Abu Omar’s romantic frame incongruously sits (from the shattered shutters shielding paneless windows to the shrapnel strewn carpet and bedspread) is all too literal and unstaged – an admonishment for blurring the boundaries between life and art
 What we see is not an imagined projection of interior introspection or a fanciful tableau woven from waftings of symbolic smoke
 No, this is not a pipe
 It’s something far more powerful than that
Maps are more than a reflection of geography
 They tell us as much about ourselves – or the map-maker – as they do the place that they depict
 And, sometimes, in fairly whimsical ways
The London-based dealer and expert Ashley Baynton-Williams has picked out a collection of the world’s most bizarre maps for his book The Curious Map Book, some of which are on display in the British Library’s current exhibition Maps and the 20th Century: Drawing the Line
 Despite the creativity of these maps, which range from games to political cartoons, they are as instructive as they are imaginative
 “It is a very immediate insight into the mindset both of the maker and, in a sense, of the viewer
 If you’re making a map, anyone making the map puts their opinions into it – but you’re also targeting an audience that you think is going to buy it
 The more it appeals to the market, the more you’re going to sell,” he tells BBC Culture
 “Some of these maps are really very unsubtle when it comes to giving a world view
”
Each of the following 11 bizarre maps illuminates a different point of modern British history
A complete tour round the world, map game 
A complete tour round the world, 1770, Thomas Jefferys Sr (Credit: The British Library)
Published in 1770, this depiction of the world – minus Australia and Antarctica, which Europeans had yet to discover – is one of the earliest map board games to appear in England
 “It’s a lot like Snakes and Ladders: you land on certain squares and go forward, and on certain squares and go back,” Baynton-Williams says
 Except, that is, for the ‘death square’, which would end the game for that player
 Here, it was square 99: “Bahama Islands – noted for shipwrecks, and often fatal to the Spanish galleons; and to the traveller, who will be shipwrecked on these islands, and lose his chance for the game”
If the instructions seem simple, it may be because the game was aimed at children
 Specifically, it was targeted at the boys of England’s educated classes, who were being groomed to serve in the British Empire
 It was also educational: each time a player landed on a new destination, they were supposed to read aloud the accompanying description of the place
 Accordingly, much of the game’s focus is on places where the British had bases, like Madras and Bombay
 “It is very much an Anglo-centric presentation of the world,” says Baynton-Williams
 “It’s a good insight into the mind of the period
 There are some relatively rude comments about certain parts of the world and relatively nice comments about other parts
 At this point, the British weren’t very keen on the papacy, so if you land in Rome, I don’t think Jefferys is very nice about the Pope
”

By the late 18th Century, map caricatures were becoming popular
 These two, which were by well-known artist Robert Dighton and part of a series with another image of Ireland, would have been sold as art prints to customers
On the left, England and Wales are depicted as John Bull riding a sea-creature, perhaps a shark
 “John Bull really is the British version of Uncle Sam: it’s a general depiction of the country as a person,” Baynton-Williams says
 “Sometimes it can be quite military; other times, it’s much more a sort of a happy, rural man
” Like here, where John Bull is held clutching a foaming pint
 At right, Scotland is shown in a clown’s cap, carrying a cloth bag of tartan over one shoulder
“They’re great fun,” Dighton says
 “Because Dighton was so famous, and because the image is so immediate, it was extensively copied
”
A new map of England and France

This caricature shows England and Wales – with the face of King George III – defecating an armada of ships from Portsmouth onto France
 “I suspect that this sort of toilet humour was probably a little bit more acceptable then than, perhaps, it is now
 I think it would have been seen as quite rude, but within the bounds of acceptability,” says Baynton-Williams
 The map also, of course, spoke to the ongoing Anglo-French war: after an uneasy, decade-long peace, the French Revolution had pitted the old rivals against one another once again
But the map is about more than the war, Baynton-Williams points out
 “There’s a huge amount of concern in England about republicanism, both in France and the effect it might have in England,” he says
 “So it’s partly the King defecating on republicans, as well as the United Kingdom [defecating] on its old enemy
”
Picturesque round game of England and Wales 
Picturesque round game of the produce and manufactures of the counties of England and Wales, 1844, Edward Wallis (Credit: The British Library)
Like the round-the-world game, this map, too, was intended to teach
 But this time, not about the British Empire, but about an exciting development at home: the Industrial Revolution
“The Industrial Revolution is not in its heyday, exactly, but it’s building up to that
 And it really is changing the way that England made money,” Baynton-Williams says
 “If you’re part of that educated class, it’s important for you to understand whatever it is – steel-making in Sheffield, or coal in Yorkshire and Wales – and the benefit that that has for the economy
”
That didn’t mean that the map-maker seemed fond of every place on the list
 Although Manchester, “the largest manufacturing town in the world”, was given an adoring description – “Stop while the others draw once; examine the vast magazines of goods produced by the woollen, silk, and cotton factories, and admire the powers of steam, from which this place derives its importance” – Sheffield appeared to be a little less favoured
 “This town makes cutlery and plated goods for the world
 It is a dirty, black, smoky place, but has many fine buildings,” the city’s description reads
The new game of the Royal Mail or London to Edinburgh by L & NW Railway, 1850

This game educated its young players on the importance of the British rail network
 “It’s bigging up the benefits of the railway
 At this time, the rail network in England and Scotland is booming,” Baynton-Williams says
 The railway owed its success partly to the Industrial Revolution and need to move goods, but also to a growing middle class, which had the time and money for recreational travel
In this game, players each received a train engine and start at Euston station, London
 From there, they have to get to Edinburgh
 Landing on a square with a ‘stop’ signal (rather than an ‘all clear’) meant not being able to move at all
 Different stations, meanwhile, had different activities: if a player stopped at Lancaster, he had pay one stake to visit the castle; at Wolverton, remain an extra turn to see the railway carriage works

Published in the periodical St Stephen’s Review, this map commented on the political struggle over the question of Home Rule for Ireland
 Prime Minister Lord Salisbury of the Conservative party is depicted as St George; the dragon has the features of William Gladstone of the Liberal party, who supported Home Rule
 Gladstone’s bill to grant self-governance was defeated in Parliament in 1886, resulting in riots in Belfast, and paved the way for Salisbury’s victory in the following general election
“Home Rule for Ireland has been a bitter topic for any number of years
 But in the 1880s, how to deal with the ‘Irish question’ was one of the main distinctions between the English political parties – so in a sense, for what turned out to be a violent struggle, it seems appropriate that you’ve got two main characters with one stabbing the other,” Baynton-Williams says
 “I can’t remember anything much earlier than that which actually represents the different parties in England, as it were, at war with each other
”
John Bull and his friends

“At this period, you’re getting the polarising of the different countries into the two alliances that would fight the First World War,” Baynton-Williams says
By 1900, the British Empire was in the midst of the Boer War; despite official neutrality, most European powers – particularly the Dutch and Germans – sided with the Boers
 The map reflects these dynamics
 Britain is shown here as John Bull, the soldier, who blithely fights off two wild cats (named Transvaal and the Orange Free State) and stands over ammunition labelled with countries of the British Empire that had been supporting Britain, like Canada and India
 “It is very much Britain against the rest,” says Baynton-Williams
Ireland, whose arms are raised in fury against John Bull, is explained in the text: “The Nationalist section in Ireland takes this opportunity to vent her abuse on him, but is restrained by the loyalty of the people”
 Spain and France look on, doing nothing, while Germany is depicted by the emperor building battleships
 Russia, meanwhile, has morphed into an octopus stretching its tentacles to eastern Europe and across Asia
 “A lot of things have been said about Russia as an octopus: an evil creature of the deep that’s very scary, that people don’t really know much about – but that, once it’s got hold of you, will drag you down to the depths,” Baynton-Williams says
 Four years later, the Russo-Japanese war would start

“Jane Austen’s earliest writings appear to have little in common with the restrained and realistic society portrayed in her adult novels,” writes Kathryn Sutherland, a professor of English at the University of Oxford
 “By contrast, they are exuberantly expressionistic tales of sexual misdemeanour, of female drunkenness and violence
”
A different side to the British novelist can be seen in the three notebooks of her early writings that still survive
 Thought to have been written when Austen was between the ages of 11 and 17, they contain stories, dramatic sketches and a spoof history
 For the first time in 40 years, they’ve been brought together for a display at the British Library
 They reveal a precocious talent – copying the format of 18th-Century novels, with ‘Volume the First’, ‘Volume the Second’ and ‘Volume the Third’ inscribed on their front covers
“Right through her juvenile writing, she’s already quite assured in her style – she can imitate the kind of writings that she would have read as a child,” Sandra Tuppen, a curator at the British Library, tells BBC Culture
 “It’s very satirical
 She’s quite assured in taking off the style – and you find that right through the teenage notebooks

As well as a table of contents and dedications written in the style of fawning odes to patrons, the first volume lists 12 chapters
 “She says it’s a novel in 12 chapters – but each chapter is just a sentence or two, so she’s taking off the style of the novel without writing a serious novel herself at this stage
 It’s intentional,” Tuppen says
Funny girl
While the writings take the form of short works, they reveal the humour that lights up Austen’s novels
 “They’re so lively; the stories are so witty,” says Tuppen
 “They’re not what one would expect from an average teenage girl, especially not an 18th-Century teenage girl living in the seclusion that one might imagine of her family
”

It’s been suggested that this portrait of Queen Elizabeth I was based on Jane’s mother, and the image of Queen Mary I could be Jane (Credit: British Library)
According to Professor Sutherland, many of the early writings “are comic imitations or parodies of popular novels: of the classic Sir Charles Grandison by her favourite Samuel Richardson; of Oliver Goldsmith’s schoolroom textbook, The History of England (4 vols, 1771); of the essayists Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson
”
Austen’s History of England – written when she was 16 – is a spoof account of England from Henry IV to Charles I as told by “a partial, prejudiced, & ignorant historian”
“A note on the bottom of the first page marks out the tone of the tale,” writes Sutherland
 It reads: “NB There will be very few Dates in this history”
Austen’s sister Cassandra created illustrated portraits for the history, many of them looking more like men and women from the time of writing than regal figures of the past
 “Henry VII looks particularly haggard,” writes Sutherland
 The portraits might have been modelled on members of their family
 “It’s been suggested that the rather severe portrait of Elizabeth is possibly Austen’s mother,” says Tuppen
 “There’s a charming picture of Mary as young girl, and it’s been suggested that could be Jane herself
”
Family affair
Austen was given the notebooks by her father, and came from “a family of talented amateur writers”, according to Sutherland
 “Her mother wrote playful verses, riddles and charades; her elder brothers James and Henry jointly founded and largely wrote a humorous weekly paper, The Loiterer, while students at St John’s College, Oxford… The Austen siblings grew up composing riddles, poems and charades to amuse one another
”
These are not secret or agonised confessions entrusted to a private journal and for the writer’s eyes alone
These notebooks were part of that tradition
 “They are semi-public manuscripts intended for circulation and performance among family and friends,” writes Sutherland
 “Unlike many teenage writings (then and now), these are not secret or agonised confessions entrusted to a private journal and for the writer’s eyes alone
 Rather, they are stories to be shared and admired by an audience; most are accompanied by an elaborate dedication to a family member or friend, and they are filled with allusions to shared jokes and events
”

Austen transcribed what people thought of Mansfield Park in this list (Credit: British Library)
The British Library display includes Austen’s handwritten notes on what family and friends thought of her third novel, Mansfield Park
 It’s a fascinating document, revealing how much she cared about the opinions of others – and the humour she could bring to a list
“When Mansfield Park was published, she didn’t get a review, so this was a nice way for her to find out more about what people thought about it,” Tuppen tells BBC Culture
 “It is quite revealing she kept them and transcribed them all onto these sheets of paper – she could have just heard what people said and kept a mental note but instead she transcribes them all, and it then becomes a piece of writing of her own
 Obviously she’s interpreted what people have said, if it’s something that’s been said to her verbally, and therefore it’s a nice example of her own writing as well
 Some of them are so witty that you think there’s something of Jane Austen in them, particularly when she talks about some of the more negative ones
”
Austen’s mother, Cassandra, didn’t think Mansfield Park was as good as Pride & Prejudice and found the heroine, Fanny, “insipid”, while a family friend, Augusta Brownstone, preferred it to Austen’s other books, although she “imagined that might be her want of taste – as she does not understand wit”
Feisty women
The stories in the notebooks seem different from Austen’s later work
 “They are characterised by exaggerated sentiment and absurd adventures,” writes Sutherland, and Tuppen argues that “they’re racier than her later novels – there’s murder and violence, which don’t crop up in her later novels – she’s obviously got these from the stories that she read, so she must have had access to some racy literature
”
Common to all three notebooks is their portrayal of confident, wilful, even rebellious young women
Yet there are some overlaps
 “Common to all three notebooks is their portrayal of confident, wilful, even rebellious young women: heroines like Charlotte Lutterell of ‘Lesley Castle’ (Volume the Second) and Catherine or Kitty… in the longer ‘Kitty, or the Bower’ in Volume the Third,” writes Sutherland
 “There is ample evidence that the same critical intelligence that created these satirical depictions of the conventions and stereotypes of late 18th-Century fiction… continued to work within the more realistic framework of her mature novels
”
First drafts of books later published as Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey were written soon after the last of the teenage notebooks
 “It is not too fanciful to find traces of the strong-minded heroines of these early experiments in Elizabeth Bennet’s unladylike energy (‘crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles’, Pride and Prejudice, ch
 7) and Emma Woodhouse’s dangerously undisciplined imagination
”António da Madelena, a Portuguese Capuchin friar, was one of the first Western visitors to Angkor Wat, the monumental and moated 12th Century Hindu-Buddhist temple in what, today, is northern Cambodia
 It “is of such extraordinary construction”, he told the historian Diogo do Couto in 1589, “that it is not possible to describe it with a pen, particularly since it is like no other building in the world
 It has towers and decoration and all the refinements which the human genius can conceive of
”
Europeans were baffled for centuries by what they found at Angkor
By the time of Madelena’s visit, the once mighty Khmer Empire that had built Angkor and its temple dedicated to Vishnu – mistaken by visitors even today for a walled and towered city – had fallen
 Three centuries later, Europeans were baffled by what they found at Angkor
 Henri Mouhout, a young French naturalist and explorer who died here in 1861 and whose writings, published posthumously, encouraged successive waves of archaeologists to Cambodia in pursuit of a lost ancient civilisation, could make neither head nor tail of what he saw

Angkor Wat is the largest religious complex in the world, covering a space of 500 acres (2 sq km) – it was initially built as a Hindu temple to honour Vishnu (Credit: Alamy)
“One of these temples – a rival to that of Solomon and erected by some ancient Michelangelo might take an honourable place beside our most beautiful buildings,” he wrote
 “It is grander than anything left to us by Greece or Rome, and presents a sad contrast to the state of barbarism in which the nation is now plunged
”
It seemed inconceivable to Mouhout that the “barbaric” Khmers could have built Angkor Wat, let alone the other temples and palaces spread around it across some 500 acres (2 sq km)
 But, the Khmers did build Angkor Wat at the zenith of their once dynamic empire that, founded in 802, fell in 1431 when the rival Ayutthaya (Thai) kingdom to the north sacked Angkor
 The seat of the remnant Khmer kingdom moved to Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital today
Stranded in the jungle
Although Angkor Wat and its attendant cities, temples, reservoirs, terraces, pools and palaces have been a magnetic 21st Century tourist attraction – when I came here in the mid-1990s I would have been one of around 7,500 annual visitors; last year there were 2
5 million, very many from China
Angkor Wat was the epicentre of a sprawling city at least as big as Berlin
We now know, thanks to the forensic aerial mapping conducted since 2007 by Damian Evans and Jean-Baptiste Chevance, using ground-sensing radar developed by Nasa in the 1960s, that Angkor Wat was the epicentre of a sprawling city at least as big as Berlin
 At its zenith during the reign of Jayavarman VII (1181-1218), it was the mighty heart of the largest empire of its time
(Credit: Alamy)

In 2012, Evans, a faculty member of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Sydney and founding member and deputy director of the Greater Angkor Project, and Chevance, an archaeologist with the École française d’Extrême-Orient, founded in 1900, discovered the ‘lost city’ of Mahendraparvata on the plateau of Phnom Kulen
 Twenty-five miles north of Angkor, this planned city with its grid of boulevards had been hidden by vegetation for centuries
 Founded by the warrior-priest monarch Jayavarman II in 802, it was the ‘template’ of Angkor and its great temple
 Since 2012, Mahendraparvata has proved to be even bigger than Evans and Chevance had first thought
(Credit: Wikipedia)
This drawing of the temple’s façade was made by Henri Mouhout, a French explorer who visited the site in the mid 19th Century and could not believe his eyes (Credit: Wikipedia)
The discovery of this city was only possible thanks to Lidar, a form of aerial laser scanning that, mounted in helicopters, sees through the ground below, identifying streets and buildings where all the human eye can see is fields and forests
 Expensive until recently, the technology is now available to archaeologists and, operated in the near future by drones rather than helicopters, it may well enable them to make further astounding discoveries, especially of fabled ‘lost cities’
(Credit: Alamy)
Jayavarman VII was the ruler of the Khmer Empire from 1181 to 1218 and is widely regarded as its most powerful leader – he oversaw the completion of the temple (Credit: Alamy)
It may have been possible to make such discoveries some years earlier in Cambodia, but until 1998 Phnom Kulem was the last refuge of Pol Pot and his murderous Khmer Rouge, the fanatical Communist organisation that ruled the country from 1975 to 1979, executing and starving to death some two million people, or a fifth of the population
 The area remains alive with landmines
If the discovery of the scale and ambition of Mahendraparvata was a remarkable event, the uncovering of the sheer scale of Angkor has been mind-bending
 From its moated temple with its lotus-bud towers, its courtyards and galleries, friezes of warriors, kings, demons, battles and three thousand heavenly nymphs, all shaped in thirty-seven years by 300,000 workers and 6,000 elephants, or so inscriptions say, from millions of sandstone slabs floated down from Phnom Kulen, Angkor stretched for miles around
Urban planning
This, perhaps, was the first low-density city – a phenomenon normally associated with the railway age, the car and the spread of suburbia – a vast-reaching conurbation, its parts linked by an ambitious network of roads and canals, reservoirs and dams carved from the forest
Angkor, like many cities today, simply overextended itself
What’s more, Khmer cities were connected to one another, so the “built-up” area of Angkor seems to have been bigger than anyone today, much less barefoot 16th Century Portuguese friars, has been able to figure
 An enormous and intricate irrigation system mapped by Evans and Chevance provided Angkor with food – rice for the main part – and yet the ever-increasing scale of this engineered and well populated landscape was, it seems, its undoing
(Credit: Alamy)
The Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, were responsible for the deaths of almost a quarter of Cambodia’s population – they held out near Angkor Wat until 1999 (Credit: Alamy)
Put simply, Angkor overreached itself – like many modern cities worldwide today
 It was not simply military invasion from what is now Thailand that hastened the fall of the Khmer Empire, but the imperious ambition of rulers and cities
 What proved to be overpopulation caused unsustainable deforestation, the degradation of topsoil and the overworking of the irrigation system that would have required a huge workforce to keep it in a permanent state of good repair
For all the raised roadways with rest houses sited every 15km (9 miles) and hospitals built by Jayavarman VII, who used ambitious architecture and grand plans to keep the peace as well as to express the confidence and culture of the Khmer Empire, the jungle would reclaim these mighty works
(Credit: Alamy)

Angkor today, along with such romantic temples as Jayavarman VII’s Ta Prohm, where enormous cotton silk trees and their fairy-tale roots appear to hold the architecture in wild embrace, and known to cinema goers through the film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), is threatened anew not by invading armies but by mass tourism
 Already, brash new ‘luxury’ air-conditioned tour-group hotels, featuring swimming pools, hot tubs and spas, dominate the once small French Colonial town of Siem Reap, no longer a walk, but now an air-conditioned coach ride from Angkor Wat
Such is the use of water by the millions of tourists heading this way each year that the water table of the area under sandy soil is threatened
 Its decline is damaging the very stones of the 12th-Century temple; meanwhile, visitors take photographs of themselves and shout into theirΩΩ mobile phones
As laser-mapping technology becomes more readily available, perhaps archaeologists might help to divert some of the millions heading to Angkor Wat to elsewhere in Cambodia and Southeast Asia
 Even so, what Angkor has that will keep drawing the crowds is the world’s biggest temple – and one that remains enigmatically magnificent
Nominated for eight Oscars, including best picture, best director and best supporting actor and actress, Moonlight has drawn praise for being “so good it may restore your faith in cinema”
It’s the story of a young gay black man in Miami told in three acts – with three actors playing the character, from bullied child to hardened man
 He is mentored by a drug dealer played by Mahershala Ali, who spoke to Tom Brook about the attraction of the role
 “He is a character that’s multidimensional, he has attributes that I aspire to have – he’s kind, he’s gentle, he’s wise, he’s loving, but he’s also someone who comes from really challenging circumstances
”
Director Barry Jenkins adapted the screenplay from an autobiographical play by Tarell Alvin McCraney
 He relished the chance to write about a community that can be neglected
 “These characters are people that we don’t see very often,” he tells Brook
 “When you don’t see people they become invisible, they become voiceless
”Tired of the selfie, the egocentric craze that injected new life into the self-portrait
 We might be in for what promises to be another digital phenomenon, one likewise capable of reinvigorating an antiquated mode of visual expression – something we could call the ‘Viral Vanity’
A photo that has gone viral after it was posted on reddit this week struck some readers as capturing the outrageous excesses of the ultra-wealthy
 The image seems to show row after row of hooded falcons in the cabin of an aeroplane, each one occupying its very own seat
 Conveying birds of prey in such fashion was reportedly the extravagance of a wealthy Saudi prince
 Whether each of the falcons on board was also in possession of its own passport (a luxury that at least one country, United Arab Emirates, provides in order to protect against smuggling), is not known
 The practice of transporting falcons by air is not uncommon: Qatar Airways has its own ratecard for avian airfares, which can reach $630 (£500) per bird

Some users of social media argued that purchasing airfares for winged creatures was absurd
 Others read the photo not as a jocular meme-in-waiting, but as a sober social document that sheds light on worldly riches
 Looked at that way, the photo unexpectedly succeeds in resuscitating a moribund category of art that went out of fashion 400 years ago: the vanitas
In vogue chiefly in the Netherlands and Flanders during the 16th and 17th Centuries, the vanitas was a sub-genre of still life
 It brought together collections of objects symbolising the transience of earthly achievements and pleasures
 Among the most celebrated masters of that type of expression is the Dutch Golden Age artist Edward Collier, whose 1705 painting An Allegory of Wealth and Temporal Power is emblematic of the admonitory style
(Credit: Wikimedia)

Overloaded with opulent baubles that look as if they could clatter to the floor at any moment, the table in Collier’s painting groans under the weight of vainglorious props: a globe that appears to fight back the encroachment of evening shadows, a teetering portrait of a ruler who will never be so young again, and the weather-curled pages of a book that reads “no-one can regard himself blessed before death”
 Placed alongside this week’s photo of what is said to be a wealthy prince’s feathery entourage, Collier’s painting demands we consider the future into which the soul blindly flies
My grandfather, JRR Tolkien, died when I was 14
 He remains vivid to me but through child-like impressions – velvet waistcoats and pipe smoke; word games played on rainy afternoons in the lounge of a seaside hotel or standing on the windy beach down below, skipping flat black pebbles out across the grey waves; a box of matches that he had thrown up in the air to amuse me, rising and falling as if in slow motion through the branches of a horse chestnut tree

These memories did nothing to illuminate who my grandfather was or how he thought beyond a sense of wise benevolence arching over me like that tree
 Nothing except for his religion: I remember the emotion in his voice when he recited prayers with me in the evening – not just the Hail Mary and the Our Father but others too - and the embarrassment I felt at church on Sundays when he insisted on kneeling while everyone else stood, and loudly uttering responses in Latin when everyone else spoke in English

My grandfather was not just the author of The Lord of the Rings but an intellectual giant
There was a clue here to his personality: an impressive confidence in his own opinions and a steely self-belief that had nothing to do with the avuncular, affectionate grandfather that I knew
 I was too young of course to wonder then about how he reconciled the pantheistic world that he had created with his own fervent Christianity
Later I came to realise that my grandfather was not just the author of The Lord of the Rings but also an intellectual giant, who spoke and read numerous languages and was a world-renowned expert in his chosen field
 My father has devoted himself tirelessly to editing my grandfather’s unpublished writing for publication in the 43 years since his death and this has so far run to more than 20 books
Mining memories
As a man, I felt dwarfed: how could I not
 And in my own middle age spurred me on to have something of my own to know myself by; to become a writer myself
 This wasn’t easy
 I thought my first book was a masterpiece, but the unanimous negative reaction of numerous literary agents on both sides of the Atlantic soon convinced me of my error
 But I persisted and slowly found some measure of success
 I had thought of my grandfather as an obstacle; he had become the great tree casting the long shadow from which I wanted to escape
 Was I to be Simon Tolkien or just the grandson of a great man
Somewhat ironically, I soon found that I needed my grandfather to sell my books
 Writers cannot succeed without publicity, and my name was my passport to gaining media attention
 Interviewers understandably wanted to know what it was like to be JRR Tolkien’s grandson and so I mined my memories until they became stale: gold turned to dust in my hand
War memorial

I had always wanted to write about World War One
 In the small English villages where I grew up the war memorials were engraved with long lists of men who had never come back from the trenches
 They had left their homes for the first time in 1914, singing as they marched away towards the great adventure, only to find hell on the other side of the English Channel
 Warfare had changed forever in the 100 years since Waterloo
 Killing had become an industrial process and flesh and blood could not match high explosive shells and machine gun bullets
The soldiers waited for death in mud-filled holes in the ground, terrified of the day when they would be ordered over the top
 So many died wretched anonymous deaths in no man’s land, bleeding away, parched by an intolerable thirst
 I saw their young faces in old sepia-tinted Edwardian photographs: innocent with no awareness of the horrors that lay ahead, and I wanted to try to bring their experience to life
 But for a long time, I did not feel ready; I was daunted by the size of the undertaking
‘Industrialised evil’
Finally, I began
 And as the chapters unfolded, I thought more and more of my grandfather, who had also fought in the Battle of the Somme
 I had a photograph of him too: handsome and resolute in his officer’s uniform, with an unfamiliar moustache
 If he hadn’t survived I wouldn’t exist
 I wished that I had known him for longer so that I might have asked him about his experience
 He had left no written record and, like many veterans, he had apparently rarely spoken of his ordeal
Tolkien soldier

But then I went back to The Lord of the Rings and realised how much his grand conception had to have been informed by the horrors of the trenches
 Evil in Middle Earth is above all industrialised
 Sauron’s orcs are brutalised workers; Saruman has ‘a mind of metal and wheels’; and the desolate moonscapes of Mordor and Isengard are eerily reminiscent of the no man’s land of 1916
Frodo shares the fate of so many veterans who remain scarred by invisible wounds when they return home
The companionship between Frodo and Sam in the latter stages of their quest echoes the deep bonds between the British soldiers forged in the face of overwhelming adversity
 They all share the quality of courage which is valued above all other virtues in The Lord of the Rings
 And then, when the war is over, Frodo shares the fate of so many veterans who remain scarred by invisible wounds when they return home, pale shadows of the people that they once were
Mount Doom

There is a sense too that the world has been fundamentally changed by Sauron even though he has been defeated
 Innocence and magic are disappearing from Middle Earth as the elves leave, departing into the West
 And I think that my grandfather must have felt the same about Europe in the aftermath of the Great War: how terrible it must have been to fight ‘the war to end all wars’ only to have to send your sons to fight in another war 20 years later
In my book, No Man’s Land, I wrote about an orphan, Adam who, like my grandfather, won a scholarship to Oxford and fell in love, but then had to leave his hopes and his beloved behind to go to France, knowing that he would be unlikely to return
 Adam is changed forever by his experience just as my grandfather was, and in telling his story, I feel that I have forged a bond with my grandfather and honoured his memory; by following in his footsteps, I can finally come out of his shadow
Simon Tolkien is the author of No Man’s Land, which is inspired by the real-life experiences of his grandfather, JRR Tolkien, during World War One (Doubleday/Nan A Talese, on sale January 2017

We asked you to vote on who you thought should win – and received more than 140,000 votes
 Some of the results fit with prevailing opinion – but there were a few surprises
Denzel Washington led the pack for best actor with his role in Fences, garnering 28% of the votes, with Manchester by the Sea’s Casey Affleck trailing at 26%
 While Affleck has been tipped to win by many critics, Washington did bag the Screen Actors Guild Award – and if he wins, would join the select group of six actors who have won more than two Oscars
 In the best supporting actor category, favourite Mahershala Ali came second with 31% for his performance in Moonlight, behind Lion’s Dev Patel at 35% – who might feel the wind behind his back after winning a Bafta
Yet, going with the odds, Emma Stone pipped Natalie Portman to top the best actress category, at 27% against 25%
 Isabelle Huppert – who won a Golden Globe for her performance in Elle – only received 10% of the votes
 And you’d made up your minds about who is most likely to win best supporting actress – Viola Davis has been the critics’ pick from the start, for what’s arguably more of a starring role in Fences
 She had one of the biggest leads in the poll, the choice of a third of the voters
La La Land’s Damien Chazelle – whose 2014 film Whiplash won three Oscars – was your pick for best director, with 31% of the vote
 Mel Gibson came a surprising second for Hacksaw Ridge, nudging Moonlight’s Barry Jenkins into third by just 50 votes
Iranian director Asghar Farhadi boycotted the ceremony after the so-called ‘Muslim ban’ that restricted travel to the US; his film The Salesman is your choice for best foreign language film, beating second-place Toni Erdmann by 2,500 votes
And you went with the favourite for best film: more than a fifth of the votes went to La La Land, which might scoop the most Oscars ever if it wins more than 11 awards on Sunday night
 Moonlight followed at 14%, with Arrival a close third at 12%
The poll winners
Best actor: Denzel Washington
Best Actress: Emma Stone
Best supporting actor: Dev Patel
Best supporting actress: Viola Davis
Best director: Damien Chazelle
Best foreign language film: The Salesman
Best film: La La LandWhen Buffy Summers first arrives in Sunnydale, the last thing she wants to do is slay vampires
 She wants to do science projects, date boys, make friends, and even make enemies – as long as those enemies are more along the lines of cheerleading rivals, rather than vampire masters set on destroying the world via Sunnydale’s Hellmouth
She does everything she can to resist her destiny as the Slayer, but by the end of the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, there is no doubt: she must rise to the talents she’s been given
 And upon slaying the Master, she reluctantly accepts this destiny herself
(Credit: 20th Century Fox Television)

Buffy showed us what television could do, and was about to do
But Buffy had another destiny as well – as the harbinger of the current ‘Golden Age of Television’
 When the show premiered in 1997, it seemed at worst a joke, at best a novelty destined for a short life
 Instead it contained the seeds of a startling number of trends to come for the medium
 Of course, Buffy was a watershed moment for the portrayal of young women on television, giving us a witty, smart heroine uniquely equipped to do no less than save the world
 And it brought vampires back well before the age of Twilight
 But it also innovated in more artful ways: combining fantasy and grounded realism in a way that prefigured everything from Alias and Lost to Jane the Virgin and the many superhero shows we have today; displaying a postmodern self-consciousness that’s ubiquitous in current programming; and experimenting with the form of television itself via a silent episode and a musical episode
 In short, Buffy showed us what television could do, and was about to do
Buffy’s maiden run in pop culture came in a 1992 film starring Kristy Swanson and written by Joss Whedon
 The writer had envisioned a movie that would subvert horror clichés: he told Time magazine that he’d thought, "I would love to see a movie in which a blonde wanders into a dark alley, takes care of herself and deploys her powers
" But director Fran Ruben Kuzui turned Whedon’s script into “a broad comedy,” as Whedon later said, instead of adhering to his original vision of a “scary film about an empowered woman”
 The result was a poorly reviewed flop
 A few years later, Whedon brought his original vision to television, which turned out to suit it better, allowing an unfolding mythology and a coming-of-age story that could develop over a number of years
Girl power
The two-hour series premiere first aired in the United States on The WB network on 10 March 1997
 In it Buffy, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, tried to start her life fresh at a new school only to find herself pulled back into the slayer duties she thought she’d left behind when she moved
 Critics loved its genre-mashing from the start; Time magazine called it “the most talked-about show to have debuted in the past months”
 The magazine added, “Buffy churns a wry, ongoing parable of the modern woman's greatest conflict: the challenge to balance personal and professional life
” Throughout the first season, the show followed a fairly linear progression, with each episode featuring a monster-of-the-week for Buffy to vanquish with the help of her friends Xander and Willow and ‘Watcher’-turned-school librarian Giles, played by English actor Anthony Head

Buffy’s romance with vampire-turned-ally Angel (David Boreanaz, right) hooked audiences long before the age of Twilight (Credit: Alamy)
The empowered heroine and monster-laden plots lent Buffy a cross-gender appeal and a subversive edge
It wasn’t until the first season finale that Buffy grew more complex as a character, as did Buffy the TV show
 In its subsequent six seasons, it developed a life-shattering romance between Buffy and her broody vampire ally Angel (David Boreanaz), introduced bad-guy-turned-good Spike, faced the complications of sex and death, and bestowed upon Willow her own powers as well as a then-groundbreaking romance with another girl
 The empowered heroine and the monster-laden plots lent it a cross-gender appeal and a subversive edge: "If I can make teenage boys comfortable with a girl who takes charge of a situation without their knowing that's what's happening, it's better than sitting down and selling them on feminism," Whedon told Time
Buffy’s complexity soon won critical acclaim and a rabid cult following
 In fact, it was supposed to end with Buffy’s death in the fifth season finale, The Gift, but it was so popular that Whedon agreed to revive her for two more (less-focused) years on a new network, UPN
 When the show ended for good in 2003, critics eulogised it despite acknowledgements that it had lived past its prime
 “Blending fantasy with social realism, Whedon made the least-condescending show about young adults to run on prime time in recent memory,” Slate’s Hillary Frey wrote

After Buffy’s finale, its mystique only grew
 Its metaphorical depiction of the horrors of high school held up for new generations of DVD viewers and then streamers
 It provided a deeper portrait of vampires – and the teen girls who love and/or slay them – than the Twilight craze of the late 2000s and beyond
 The ‘kick-ass heroine’ became something of a trope – a welcome one – thanks to Buffy
 But most of all, the show’s realistic relationships and elaborate mythology make for perfect viewing in the age of binge-watching
But it isn’t just new young fans who are enamored
 A few years ago, Slate determined that Buffy had become academia’s most-studied pop cultural artifact
 And its influence lives on in shows being made today: "I think Buffy has been a huge factor in what TV looks like now – the mixture of tones in shows like Orange is the New Black feels Buffy-like to me, the recognition that humour creeps into our darkest moments,” Buffy writer Jane Espenson told SyFy Wire
 Writer Drew Z Greenberg added: “Buffy established that it was okay to have a show which was both fun and intelligent – that you could be engrossing, mainstream, pop entertainment while still having something to say, still having a specific point of view about the world… And as legacies go, I think that’s a pretty good one
”
Add another title to poor Buffy’s list of grand fated destinies: Enduring Cultural Muse
There is really only one rule when it comes to the exclamation mark: don’t use it
 This is an exaggeration of course
 In fact, rare usage is the point: the Chicago Manual of Style says the exclamation mark ‘should be used sparingly to be effective
’
The 45th President of the United States does not use the exclamation mark sparingly
 In the Oval Office, exclamation points (the US term) are being issued more frequently than executive orders
 According to the Trump Twitter Archive, in 2016 alone the @realDonaldTrump posted 2,251 tweets using exclamation marks
 The ‘alternative facts’ are there for all to see: of 100 tweets I not-very-randomly picked, he used exclamation marks in all but 32 of them
 That’s a 68% likelihood of signing off a tweet with a shriek

Punctuation saves lives: there’s a meaningful difference between ‘Duck’ and ‘Duck
’
What is happening here
 Where has the exclamation mark come from and where is it going
 Do Potus’s exclamations signal a new potency for this burgeoning symbol
 Is the exclamation mark being politicised
 Does this moment mark a new dawn or is this just grammatical filibustering
As that other big man of the United States – Bill Bryson – writes, the exclamation mark is classically used ‘to show strong emotion (“Get out
”) or urgency (“Help me
”)
’ If part of the point of punctuation is to change the timbre of the voice – another part is to get you out of a hole
 Punctuation saves lives: there’s a meaningful difference between ‘Duck’ and ‘Duck
’ Both of Bryson’s examples are notable for the underlying sense of emergency, need for security, and atmosphere of fear
 No wonder, then, that newspapers have historically referred to exclamation marks as ‘astonishers’, ‘gaspers’ and ‘screamers’; no wonder newspapers have been their most voracious advocates
Dr Johnson 
The 18th-Century lexicographer Dr Johnson coined the term ‘exclamation’ for expressions involving passions (Credit: Alamy)
The loud-mouthed exclamation mark had much quieter origins
 In the late 14th Century it was called ‘the point of admiration’; by the 17th it had even become the ‘wonderer’
 Welcoming, admiring, thanking and appreciating: these are the angels of the mark’s original usage, ones that might appeal to us haggard late post-moderns
 And it’s gendered too: recent studies show that women are more likely to use exclamation marks, not because women are supposedly more ‘emotional’, but because they tend to express their admiration more
 Interestingly, one commentator noted that Trump was allowed to get away with more ‘hysterical’, ‘female’ traits during the election campaign, while his opponent – Hillary Clinton – was heavily criticised for not being ‘female’ enough: in effect, she didn’t use enough exclamation marks
The exclamation mark is the selfie of grammar
The idea of shifting from admiration to exclamation is telling: admiration is about something outside of you (‘Look at your achievement
’); exclamation is all about you (‘Aye me
’): the exclamation mark is the selfie of grammar
 In fact, the duplicity of the mark has been there for a long time
 In Randle Cotgrave’s French/English dictionary of 1611, the author describes it as ‘the point of admiration (and of detestation)’
 (As a fan of punctuation, I’m rather fond of those cloak-and-dagger brackets
) It was the bibliophile Dr Johnson who then coined the term ‘exclamation’ for ‘pathetical’ sentences – those involving passions – from where it became the ‘exclamation point’ in the USA and ‘exclamation mark’ in Britain
 (For more on this fascinating history, I point you to David Crystal’s Making a Point
)
‘The mark of the internet’
Punctuation marks in general, and exclamations in particular, were much more frequently used up until the end of the 19th Century
 The Victorians had a real predilection for the exclamation mark
 Anton Chekhov even wrote a short story for them called The Exclamation Mark – about a paranoid civil servant, very unlike Trump, who in 40 years realised he hadn’t used an exclamation mark once
 After the turn of the century, it was the lexicographer Fowler brothers, in their King’s English from 1906, who called for all quiet on the exclamation front, arguing in favour of the ‘lighter’, more minimal punctuation we still use today – a backlash against the grammatical excesses of their grandparents
Chekhov 
19th-Century writers had a predilection for the exclamation mark – Anton Chekhov even wrote a story about one (Credit: Alamy)
On exclamation marks the Fowlers were typically definitive: ‘The stop should be used, with one exception, only after real exclamations
’ The ‘real exclamations’ they describe are roughly what we already know (interjections, expletives, commands, pronouncements of surprise); the exception they refer to is rather telling: for ‘when the writer wishes to express his own incredulity or other feeling about what is not his own statement, but particularly a quotation from someone else
’ This is, they continue, when the exclamation mark is ‘a neat and concise sneer’
How you punctuate your sentences might have something to do with how you punctuate your life
The Fowlers’ exception is our rule
 The use of the exclamation mark as the sneer mark, or ironic mark, or laughing-at-your-own-joke mark (as F Scott Fitzgerald roughly said), is so last century it’s this century
 The exclamation mark behooves the ‘End of History’
 It is certainly the mark of the internet: email, chat forums, social media and comment threads have all engendered a culture of multiple exclamation mark usage and abusage
 It’s really interesting
 The more you use them, the more you need to use them
 The more you need to use them, the more you increasingly make no sense
 (And yet: isn’t there also a grain of truth in amongst all this exclamation
 Isn’t there a half way between ‘excited’ and ‘really excited’ and another half way again, and another…
 Is there not a strange logic to the volume and the vacuum
)
Trump rally 
Trump’s overuse of the exclamation on Twitter displays wonderment, but fear and sneer too (Credit: AFP/Getty)
The exclamation mark is certainly not an uncomplicated piece of punctuation: but this is no sophisticated colon ‘delivering the goods that have been invoiced in the preceding words’ (the Fowlers again); nor is this the ‘drooping moustache’ of the semicolon with a ‘gamey taste’ (Adorno)
 The exclamation mark lacks the rigour of the life-breathing comma, sorting out our lives for us, bit by bit, and it certainly doesn’t have the pace of the dash – used so beautifully devastatingly by Emily Dickinson
 No subtlety for the exclamation mark, unlike the ellipsis – spot those hidden ‘lips’ – with that sense of a kiss…
It is anyone’s guess why the Tweeter of the Free World is so free with his exclamation points
 There’s admiration there, for sure, and wonderment, I think
 But there’s fear, too, it cannot be denied: fear and sneer
 Overuse of any punctuation mark tells us something about ourselves, in the same way overuse of any object does
 How you punctuate your sentences might have something to do with how you punctuate your life
 What now for the mark of admiration and detestation
 To end on one of Trump's own: Stay tuned
Philip Cowell’s new book about punctuation, This Is Me, Full Stop, is published by Penguin later this year
The question most important to good science fiction isn’t “What if
” but “What then
” The premise of Charlie McDowell’s The Discovery – what if we knew the afterlife was real
 – has naturally been getting much of the attention devoted to the film at Sundance
 But it’s the way McDowell follows through on that idea, and how it might, or might not, change the world we know that puts The Discovery to the test
If there’s another world why not get there as soon as you can
The Discovery, which, like McDowell’s debut, The One I Love, he co-wrote with Justin Lader, opens with a jarring but gimmicky prologue
 Thomas Harbor (Robert Redford), the scientist who has provided proof that there is some form of life after death, is in the midst of defending his findings to a TV interviewer (a far-too-brief appearance by Mary Steenburgen), when a member of her crew interrupts to blow his brains out on the air
 But in contrast with last year’s twin Sundance entries about the on-camera suicide of Florida newscaster Christine Chubbuck, his action isn’t a protest so much as an invitation: if there’s another world, it can’t be worse than this one, so why not get there as soon as you can
Skip forward in time, and Thomas Harbor has gone into hiding
 Suicide has become rife, with millions worldwide taking their own lives in an effort to find out what’s next
 His son, Will (Jason Segel), a neurologist, has come to confront him, but en route to Thomas’s island retreat he meets Isla (Rooney Mara), a brooding bottle blonde who becomes both his foil and his accomplice, challenging and collaborating with him as he tries to fight his way to the truth, or at least a truth
It seems odd the film is so little concerned with religious views of the afterlife
The question of whether an afterlife exists is as much epistemological as metaphysical: if not necessarily all, at least a significant percentage of the world’s religious faithful have long had all the proof they need
 Thomas Harbor’s discovery would seem to overwhelmingly settle the question, but as his son argues, “Proof shouldn’t be overwhelming; it should be definitive
” (The extent to which that statement sounds either profound or sophomoric is a good indication of how much you’ll get out of The Discovery
) The group of followers with which Thomas Harbor surrounds himself, jumpsuited and glassy-eyed, seems more like a nascent cult than a gathering of advanced minds who’ve traded primitive superstition for fact
The descent of man
McDowell’s most inspired stroke in The Discovery is casting Robert Redford as Harbor
 Redford plays him as a homespun techno-prophet whose deafness to the consequences of publicising his findings is rooted in a kind of monstrous idealism
 To Will, he privately pooh-poohs the “theatrics” of his pseud-cult as a necessary evil, a way of keeping his followers under control – and, perhaps, keeping them alive – but he knows those theatrics also make him the cult’s de facto leader, and not a neutral conveyor of objective truths
It seems odd that a movie so concerned with life after death should make so little reference to the thousands of years of religious and philosophical thought on the subject
 It’s as if Harbor and his followers have cut themselves off not only from the world but from its history, wiped the slate clean and built a whole new system of belief from the ground up
 While The Discovery plays in many ways like a more effective version of the concept-choked Brit Marling/Zal Batmanglij movies, the cult scenes feel underdeveloped next to their film The Sound of My Voice, an intriguing but ragged thread left dangling as The Discovery turns towards more concrete, backstory-driven explanations for its characters’ obsessions
 Riley Keough feels especially shortchanged as the most haunted of Thomas’s followers, and Jesse Plemons, as Thomas’s other, less confrontational son, feels like he’s mainly there to goose the plot along rather than to expand the movie’s ideas
McDowell has bitten off a tremendous amount in his second feature, but not all of it gets chewed
Like The One I Love, The Discovery’s most discussion-worthy aspects come in its twisty final act, a conversation that will have to be tabled for a later date
 Suffice to say that as Thomas’s research continues and Will and Isla conduct an investigation of their own, the movie cycles from one conception of the afterlife to another, but its ending feels more like a function of sentiment than conceptual fulfillment
 McDowell has bitten off a tremendous amount in his second feature, but not all of it gets chewed
There’s something particularly fitting about seeing Redford in that part alongside his role as the keeper of Sundance’s flame, the still-powerful but incessantly compromised doctrine as the home of independent film, a term that has become impossible to define except through the (partial) absence of commercial compromise
 McDowell’s own trajectory, from the director of an intimate, provocative debut feature to the larger, more diffuse The Discovery, itself poses questions about what indie film means in the current climate, especially since, although a small theatrical release is planned, the vast majority of viewers will see it on Netflix, who acquired the movie before the festival began
 Small-screen viewing won’t help the movie, which is shot in a precise and chilly style that evokes both Kubrick and Chris Marker’s La Jetée
The Discovery is, like Arrival, a genuine movie of ideas, and if it doesn’t have the budget to echo Arrival’s global tableaux, it deftly suggests the wider effects of Thomas Harbor’s revelations: as Will takes the ferry to his father’s island, we see a rapidly escalating digital display tallying the number of global suicides, emblazoned with the hashtag “#discoverlife”
 There’s a bigger story The Discovery wants to tell, and if it doesn’t quite get around to telling it, the movie it suggests is fascinating enough to make up for some of the shortcomings of the movie it is
Even in Iraq in 2003, with Saddam Hussein still in power, with US bombings about to begin, comedian Mahir Hassan could find a reason to laugh: Saddam Hussein himself
 Hassan told his favorite Saddam joke to the Guardian in March 2003: "Saddam is addressing a convention of the blind in Baghdad on the eve of the American attack
 He tells them: 'God willing, you will see our victory
'"
Saddam ordered assassins to kill the entire cast
Hassan was one of Iraq’s most famous comedians, but he could only dare to lob his political humour from Northern Iraq, which was under Kurdish control
 Hassan had become infamous for producing a comedy film sending up Saddam in the 1990s after the Kurds had taken the north, relaxing restrictions on freedom of expression – at least a bit
 Hassan recruited his Hussein lookalike friend, Goran Faili, to play the reviled leader
 In the film, 50 Kurdish guerillas hired to play Iraqi soldiers marched around singing Long live Saddam in a parody of the TV propaganda Hussein’s regime regularly aired
 Faili’s Saddam was a rambling madman, with an emphasis on the leader’s Tikrit accent and slow movements

When the film aired on Kurdish television, it was a hit
 Saddam ordered assassins to kill the entire cast
 Faili spent years in hiding and survived several attempts on his life
 Kurdish authorities eventually arrested the would-be assassins, who were apprehended carrying a list of their targets
Trump's election has rekindled the idea that comedy can speak truth to power
Hassan and Faili’s willingness to take grave risks for a bit of satire shows how vital the right to political comedy is to freedom
 Throughout history, comedy has proven to be one of the most effective forms of resistance, especially for those under tyrannical rule; comedians can claim they were just kidding, after all, or subtly mock a leader without naming him or her
 It’s such an important release valve for any society that even some medieval monarchies made room for the masses to laugh at their leaders during the annual Feast of Fools, in which masters served slaves and peasants played at leadership positions, led by an appointed Lord of Misrule as king

The right to laugh at leaders has been taken for granted in longstanding democracies such as the US and the UK, but the election of Donald Trump as the United States’ new president appears to have renewed interest not just in speaking truth to power but poking fun at it too
Laughing bigly
When Trump’s victory first became apparent, many US comedians didn’t want to laugh at all: comedy filmmaker Judd Apatow tweeted on election night, “One thing I do not want to watch right now – comedy about any of this
” The first broadcast of satirical show Saturday Night Live (SNL) after the election featured cast member Kate McKinnon as failed candidate Hillary Clinton seriously singing a mournful version of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah
 Even the comedy show didn’t have the heart to laugh
Kate McKinnon 
After Trump’s election, some comedians turned somber, such as when Kate McKinnon, as Hillary Clinton, sang Hallelujah on Saturday Night Live (Credit: NBC)
But since then, as Trump moved towards the White House, US comedians were recalibrating their approach to skewering him
 SNL moved from its pre-election strategy of poking fun at his mannerisms and speech – and early in the campaign, even having the candidate on as a host – to a harder hitting approach
 In one more recent sketch, he was depicted as a distracted rube too busy preening on social media to take intelligence briefings – and literally being advised by Satan (a depiction of Steve Bannon, the chief executive of Breitbart News)
 Trump himself noticed the more cynical depiction of him, and live-tweeted his ire (“unwatchable
”) without apparent irony
 He’s even suggested that the show might be cancelled soon, despite its 41-year history: “Frankly, the way the show is going now,” he said in a phone interview with the Today show, “who knows how long that show is going to be on
”
While the comedy transition parallels Trump’s transition into office, it’s instructive to look at how comedians around the world have historically taken on those in power, whether their targets were leaders of ostensibly free societies like Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi or dictators like Iraq’s Saddam Hussein
 Even Margaret Thatcher, who posed no threat to democracy, inspired an influential ‘alternative comedy’ movement through sheer dislike
 One thing’s for sure: the comedy may get bleak, but it never dies
Stern faces at the top
Perhaps the most Trumpian figure to precede Trump was Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s on-again, off-again Prime Minister for nine years in total between 1994 and 2011
 The similarities are almost overwhelming: Berlusconi was a controversy-stoking populist, a plutocrat with a penchant for pancake makeup, and a wealthy businessman who made his fortune in construction and used it to build a TV empire
 And he did not take kindly to any of this being made light of
In a 2001 interview, Italian TV journalist Enzo Biagi asked comic actor Roberto Benigni what he thought of Berlusconi, who was about to be elected to his second of three terms
 Benigni answered with a long, hysterical laugh – a laugh that continued far longer than was natural, so long that Biagi couldn’t help but join in out of sheer discomfort
 Benigni finally followed with a monologue: “Who is Berlusconi
 He is someone who always wants to be in on the act
 He wants to be everywhere
 He wants to be the star
 There's a meeting, he talks
 He goes to a wedding, he wants to be the bridegroom
 He goes to a funeral, he wants to be the deceased
” Biagi continued laughing, and Berlusconi noticed
 After the leader’s victory, he wielded his newfound power, accusing Biagi of putting public television “to criminal use”; Biagi’s show, Il Fatto, was taken off its network, RAI 1, a government-run channel

Today’s Russian comedians aren’t so lucky
 The country’s only independent TV channel, Dozhd, recently scuttled an animated series called God, How Embarrassing about an angel and two demons who live inside Putin’s head
 “They told us it was a step too far,” creator Sasha Filippenko told The Moscow Times earlier this year
One show devolved from sharp satire to uncritical praise of Putin
When Putin first took power in 2000, comedians freely joked on the air about his KGB background and stern demeanor – not exactly hard-hitting humour
 But as he engaged in a power struggle with Russia’s oligarchs, the country’s comedians stepped up their efforts against him with pointed comparisons to Stalin
 Soon, and perhaps not coincidentally, the Putin-related comedy slowed to a quiet trickle
 A puppet satire called Kukly, which depicted Boris Yeltsin lamenting having begotten such an ugly successor, was pulled from the air
 Comedy eventually began focusing on safer targets, such as Putin’s advisers, rather than the president himself
 And Russian TV’s longest-running comedy series, Club of the Funny and Witty People – known by the acronym KVN, and airing since 1986 – has devolved from sharp satire to “songs about the great leader,” as Filippenko put it, along with racist, sexist, and xenophobic jokes
 Putin is an avowed fan
Kukly 
Kukly, a show involving puppets that originally made fun of Boris Yeltsin, no longer appeared on air after it started poking fun at Vladimir Putin (Credit: Alamy)
Putin may not be known for his humour, but he clearly appreciates the political power of a clown
 He will have observed from the sidelines how Trump morphed from a disruptive, entertaining candidate whom no one took seriously to the president of the United States
 And Putin has found another ally in none other than a comedian-turned-political leader: Beppe Grillo, co-founder of Italy’s rising Five Star Movement
 Grillo, whose network of websites traffics in pro-Putin propaganda, has risen to popularity on an anti-establishment platform like Trump’s, and he celebrated Trump’s victory in his inimitably entertaining style, saying it was “a big f-you to the world
”
After the laughs
With clowns in the ascendant, we may find ourselves, paradoxically enough, in need of some seriously subversive humour
 As the case of Muammar Gaddafi shows, only one thing can kill the instinct for political satire: the demise of a dictator
Milood Amroni 
Milood Amroni had been a satirist of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, but he felt his comedy lost its punch when Gaddafi started to lose control during the Arab Spring (Credit: Alamy)
The Libyan leader made for a dangerous target when he was at the heights of his rule: dissidents were imprisoned, tortured, disappeared and killed from the 1970s through to the 2000s
 But comedians’ approach to him shows just how much satire means to oppressed populations – and isn’t nearly as vital to them once they’re freed
 Libyan comedians such as Milood Amroni spent decades slipping Gaddafi jokes to the masses before the uprising of 2011 pushed the dictator out of office and ultimately led to his death
 Amroni’s sketches avoided naming Gaddafi – a smart move when making fun of a genuinely violent autocrat – but the target was obvious: in one, two military recruits being terrorised by their training officer joke, "This is good practice for when we're bullied by the top commander
"
But once Gaddafi’s power faded, Amroni lost interest in needling the leader with humour
 "I felt that if I make jokes about Gaddafi they wouldn't be good jokes because he's too weak now and it's not good to make jokes about a weak guy," he told Reuters after the uprising (but before Gaddafi’s death)
 In fact, Amroni added that the sudden cultural freedom meant that anyone on TV and radio, or even civilians, could openly joke about Gaddafi, so he no longer needed to
 "We've never been in this sort of situation, to talk openly about politics, to make jokes about politicians," he said
 “Now the people are making the jokes and we're laughing
”
So the next time you notice that the laughter has gone quiet, it probably means one of two things: either freedom reigns supreme, or a despotic leader has silenced it
Had it been built, its spiral steel frame would have stood taller than the Eiffel Tower, at that time the world’s tallest manmade structure, by some 91m (299 ft)
 And its record as the world’s tallest building would have gone unsurpassed for over half a century, until the construction of the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers, which opened for business in 1973
The Monument to the Third International, otherwise known as Tatlin’s Tower, was designed in 1919 by Russian artist and architect Vladimir Tatlin, following the October Revolution of 1917
 It was a revolutionary design
Tatlin's Tower 
Tatlin and an assistant stand before a model of his unrealised Monument to the Third International (Credit: Alamy)
The steel frame would contain three glass units: a cube, a cylinder and a cone
 These would rotate once a year, once a month and once a day respectively, and house a conference hall, a legislative chamber and an information and propaganda centre for the Third Communist International (also known as the Comintern – the organisation that advocated world communism)
 It would stand at just over 396 m (1,306 ft)
 But for reasons of cost (Russia was bankrupt and in the middle of a civil war) and practicality (was its realisation even structurally possible, and where, after all, would they get all that steel
) this staggeringly audacious symbol of modernity was never built
  We encounter it today through photographs of the original model, long destroyed, and through reconstructions
The artist’s mission was to create work for the benefit of the people and for making a new society
Tatlin was a radical avant-garde artist before the Bolsheviks seized power: rather more modest in scale were his pre-Revolution wood and metal constructions, which he called ‘counter-reliefs’, and which overturned traditional notions of sculpture
 But Tatlin would soon become the chief proponent of a revolutionary art whose purpose was to support the utopian ideal of the Soviet state
 A new kind of art, which forcefully rejected the past, for a new world that would look only to the future
 It came to be known as Constructivism, and as an avant-garde force it co-existed alongside the Suprematism of Kazimir Malevich (whose astonishing Black Square of 1915 presented an end-point in painting) and his protégé El Lissitzky
Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge 
El Lissitzky’s Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge symbolises the Red Army penetrating the defences of the anti-communist and imperialist forces (Credit: Alamy)
The brilliant geometric abstraction of Suprematism transformed easel painting into the most radical expression of pure form and colour, but it was Lissitzky who put it most dynamically at the service of the state
 His 1919 lithograph Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge, can hardly be more politically charged
 The red wedge penetrates the white circle, which symbolises the Red Army penetrating the defences of the anti-communist and imperialist forces of the White Army
 This early work cleverly plays with negative and positive space and anticipates a group of architectonic paintings, drawings and sketches that Lissitzky called ‘Prouns’ (an acronym for ‘project for the affirmation of the new’ in Russian) which lifted the flatness of Suprematism into the three-dimensional visual plane
 It was, incidentally, this work that inspired the name of Red Wedge, a 1980s British group of Labour Party-supporting musician-activists, headed by Billy Bragg
Children of the revolution
When we think of the art and design of the first decade of the Soviet Union, we usually think only of these groundbreaking figures, designers and artists who also included Lyubov Popova, a painter who soon called for the abandonment of ‘bourgeois’ easel painting, declaring that the artist’s mission was to create work for the benefit of the people and for making a new society
 And we think too of perhaps the greatest photographer, graphic designer and typographer of the era, Alexander Rodchenko
 Rodchenko’s 1924 advertising image for a Soviet publisher, in which the model Lilya Brik gives the siren call ‘Books
’, with one hand cupped to her mouth and with the word written in bold Cyrillic type, is probably the single best known image in Soviet art history
Roschenko print

Yet many styles and movements coexisted in those first few post-Revolutionary years
 But you wouldn’t necessarily know this since curators in the west have long been interested only in the radical aesthetics of the Russian avant-garde, while happily underplaying the politics that underpinned it – shying away from its narratives, in other words – in order to highlight the work’s purely formal aspects
 This is, to be fair, also the fate of religious or spiritual works of art (esoteric spiritual beliefs, for instance, run through the story of modernism)
 We appear content to render these works all painterly surface and form and to largely ignore the things that no longer speak directly to us
In this centenary year of the October Revolution, an exhibition at London’s Royal Academy, Revolution: Russian Art 1917-1932, seeks to act as a corrective
 In this vast, sprawling and sobering exhibition we’re confronted by artists, many little-known outside Russia, who worked in a range of styles to promote the newly fledged Soviet state
 Here the traditional overwhelms the new, the figurative trounces the abstract
 And very early on we see a nascent Socialist Realism, an idealised figurative style in which the worker achieves heroic status as he or she helps build a socialist utopia, alongside 19th-Century-style realist portraits of Lenin and Stalin
 Lenin, who died in 1924, was avowedly conservative in artistic matters, and had begun to feel sure that avant-gardism would alienate the proletariat
Flame snuffed out
So here, for example, is a large model of a bronze sculpture, which, like Tatlin’s Tower, was never realised as a finished work
 It is a faintly Cubo-Futurist homage to Yakov Sverdlov, featuring the late Bolshevik official who died of the flu pandemic in 1918 (some historians now believe it was under Sverdlov’s direct orders that the exiled Romanovs were murdered)
 Though it pays a kind of lip-service to modernism, all the romanticised elements of Socialist Realism are already in place: Sverdlov holds aloft a torch, a cloak swirls about his heavy-set limbs, his hair is swept back and his head thrust forward, as if he is pushing against the ferocious winds of resistance with determined courage
Vera Mukhina’s Flame of the Revolution 
Vera Mukhina’s Flame of the Revolution was never finally realised, but the designs remain and a scaled-down version can be found in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow (Credit: Alamy)
Mukhina later became the premier female Socialist Realist sculptor under Stalin, winning numerous medals and awards and making the triumphal Worker and Kolkhoz Woman for the 1937 Paris World Fair, where it faced down the Nazi Pavilion’s equally monumental imperial eagle
 A hammer and sickle held aloft by the pair replaces the torch
 By then Mukhina’s has left behind all vestiges of the avant-garde
By the mid-20s, the Soviet state was already looking back over its triumphs in an effort at national mythmaking
By the mid-20s, with Lenin gone, the Soviet state was already looking back over its revolutionary triumphs in an effort at national mythmaking
 Among much that was crassly formulaic, Alexander Deineka was actually among the most surprisingly gifted of the Socialist Realists
 Despite its very obvious propaganda value, there is something almost strange and lyrical about his best known work, The Defence of Petrograd, from 1928, which looks back to the civil war and to October 1919, when the White Army had reached the city
 Frieze-like, we see exhausted soldiers trudging across an upper-level platform, while below, striding confidently in the other direction, are the sturdy workers, the heroes of the Revolution, who’ve been newly armed and are ready to die for the state
But the spirit of radical experimentation that had ignited earlier abstract artists was coming to a halt
 By the early 1930s Stalin had begun his deadly clampdown on the avant-garde, forcing Rodchenko and Malevich among many others, to renounce their ‘formalist’ ways
 In this poisonous atmosphere, artists, writers and filmmakers had their work heavily censored, their output micromanaged from above
 If they were to avoid the gulag there was no choice but to comply
 With Socialist Realism now the only officially sanctioned art, the tremendously dynamic avant-garde spirit that had guided these groundbreaking artists was sadly short-lived
Since Jonathan Swift’s 1712 Proposal for Correcting, Improving and Ascertaining the English Tongue, two centuries of self-appointed correctors and improvers of English usage - such as Robert Lowth, HW Fowler, George Orwell, Kingsley Amis, Simon Heffer, Lynne Truss, and Neville Gwynne - have decried the decadent state of our language and instructed people on how to use it better
 But what have they accomplished
They have helped enforce agreement that there should be a standard version of the language
 They have not, however, managed to set the exact details of that standard
 They have not even agreed whether long words or short ones are better (in spite of some vehement pronouncements on the subject)
 And the stream of the language has flowed on despite the damning practices prescribed by grammar doctors in the 1700s and 1800s that often look old-fashioned or bizarre now : no one writes snatcht, checkt, or snapt : no one uses colons as I am doing in this sentence

Generations have learned that ‘bad English’ is a failure of intellectual and moral fibre
The language cannot be fixed in place, and its constant evolution does not always follow the tastes of its self-appointed guardians
 Some of their proposed improvements have had inglorious careers: a rule - don’t split infinitives, don’t end sentences with prepositions, don’t start sentences with conjunctions - is decided in defiance of established usage
 It is promulgated in books, taught in schools, and often used as an indicator of a writer’s level of education, yet it continues to be broken - productively by some (including many of the best writers), sloppily by others, guiltily by many
It is at last declared not to be a real rule by authoritative guides in the later 20th Century, and yet it is still propounded by a small but truculent segment of society, who have unpleasant things to say about those who dare break it
 On the other hand, some words that English-defenders indignantly opposed have blithely prevailed: bureaucracy, racial, electrocute, telegram, antagonise, pants, jeopardise, donate, and scores of others

One important effect the English-improvers have had, however, is on how people feel and talk about English usage
 They have taught generations of English speakers that ‘bad English’ is a failure of intellectual and moral fibre
 Consider the adjectives they have used to condemn choices of words they disagreed with
Jonathan Swift, in 1712, talked of “Corruptions,” “Licentiousness,” and “barren” usages; Robert Lowth, in 1799, applied terms such as “perverted” and “barbarous”; Richard Grant White, in 1872, used phrases such as “utterly abominable”, “foolish and intolerable”, and said they showed “utter want of education and a low grade of intelligence” (and these against words such as donate, jeopardise, and preventative)
 HW Fowler in 1908 spoke of “barbaric” usages, and the “special ugliness” that comes from a word with a “mongrel origin”, and counselled readers that “The effect of using quotation marks with slang is merely to convert a mental into a moral weakness
” George Orwell in 1946 inveighed against “slovenliness” and “sheer incompetence
”
‘Linguistic insecurities’
In more recent years, writers guilty of some well-established word choices and writing habits have been called “slovenly” by Kingsley Amis; “abominable,” and “semi-literates” by Simon Heffer; “illiterate” by Neville Gwynne; and “moral weaklings” by Lynne Truss
 These are terms fit for war crimes or animal cruelty, but they are applied to turns of phrase that are endorsed, or at least allowed, by the Chicago Manual of Style, The New Fowler’s Modern English Usage, The New York Public Library Writer’s Guide to Style and Usage, Merriam-Webster, and the Associated Press Stylebook, all of which manage to make prescriptions without casting aspersions on the moral and intellectual character of those who do not heed them

Their ideal is a person of careful, vigorous thought, moral propriety, manly directness and the right sort of education
To be fair, these angry grammarians did not invent discrimination based on speech
 Anywhere there are different varieties of a language associated with different regions and different social sets, the way you talk will show what group you belong to, and people will decide on that basis how to treat you
 What these umpires of the English language have enabled and abetted is scorn based purely on details of the language itself rather than on extrinsic social differences
George Orwell

There is a classism in it, but their ideal is not a nobleman (they often criticise errors in the speech of the high and mighty) but a person of careful, vigorous thought, moral propriety, manly directness, and the right sort of education, as evinced unfailingly by avoidance of specified vulgarisms and barbarisms
 They despise stupidity and low character, but they enfranchise their pupils to identify these not by the content of what is said but by a few simplistic rules of form: a belt of scorn grenades
Those who take up these weapons often use them viciously
 In his recent book Bad English, the language scholar Ammon Shea has collected some striking examples
 One George Quinn, in a 2004 letter to the Providence Journal newspaper, said that a particular writer who started a sentence with a conjunction should have been “appropriately beaten in grammar class”
 The poet Phyllis McGinley said the sentence adverb ‘hopefully’ “is an abomination and its adherents should be lynched”
 Jack Knox, a columnist for the Prince George Citizen, advocated capital punishment for anyone who used ‘gift’ as a verb
 An executive at Western Union once wrote that whoever first used ‘contact’ as a verb “should have been destroyed in early childhood
”
Lynne Truss 
Correct punctuation was the subject of Lynne Truss’s hugely popular book, Eats, Shoots & Leaves (Credit: Alamy)
Those who speak in strong terms about ill-favoured usages naturally defend their passion: “I frequently hear people pointedly aver that they ‘care about language,’” Shea writes, “which to me is simply a polite way of saying ‘I like to correct the language use of other people
’ We all care about language, some of us more than others, but the degree to which one is willing to humiliate or upbraid others should not stand as an indication of how much one cares
”
The giveaway is that the focal usages are not ones that truly manifest incompetence, such as “I are come” or “Do like this speak not
” They are words and turns of phrase that are used all the time by well-educated, fluent speakers, including many who are well respected for their writing
 This allows scolds to use them as true in-group markers
 As Rebecca Gowers writes in Horrible Words, “The more arbitrary their dislike of a given word, the more honour they are likely to invest in insisting that it is incorrect, and possibly not a word at all
”

It’s easy to be drawn into this
 The English language can be confusing
 Thanks to its history, its spelling is capriciously inconsistent; thanks to the vast body of literature that has grown over the centuries of its evolution, its variations of form are manifest
 And thanks to reformers who would “correct and improve” the language, there are things we are told we should do that we can plainly see most people don’t do
 To be an English speaker is unavoidably to have some degree of what William Labov called ‘linguistic insecurity’
 People whose English is farther from the promoted ideal are more insecure, but you will not find an English speaker who does not at least occasionally fret about whether he or she is committing an error
 Even the sternest grammar cranks privately catch themselves out from time to time
It’s not so surprising that people over the centuries have wanted to tidy it all up
 But attempts at improvement have not been unequivocally successful, to say the least, and the tone in which they have been presented has done further injury
 It’s bad enough that we have to worry about being clear and consistent; thanks to the weaponisation of English grammar and vocabulary, we also have to worry about being seen as degenerate barbarian imbeciles
Is it ever too late to learn a musical instrument
 According to the leading British concert pianist James Rhodes, the answer is an emphatic ‘no’ - and he has just written the book to prove it
 The delightfully straight-talking How To Play the Piano is an elegant little volume that promises - with just 45 minutes’ practice a day, six days a week, for six weeks - to enable anyone with access to a keyboard to play one of JS Bach’s most beloved works, the Prelude no 1 in C major from Book One of The Well-Tempered Clavier
The book, Rhodes reveals, came from an overwhelming response to his excoriating 2015 memoir Instrumental, which addressed his devastating mental breakdown and the critical role music played in his recovery and redemption
 Following its publication, countless readers were moved to tell him they’d been inspired by his words to return to the piano themselves
 “I lose track of how many people have said ‘Oh, I used to play when I was a kid, I wish I’d stuck it out,’” he tells me, mentioning one particular email that sparked the idea
James Rhodes

“I got a message from a retired Mexican professional airline pilot who said: ‘I used to play as a kid but I haven’t played for 50 years
 I read Instrumental, I bought a piano, I got myself a piano teacher, now I practise every day
 And I just want you to know: these are my best days
’ I found that so moving
”
Learning a musical instrument can unlock the door to a new dimension that many of us have forgotten exists – James Rhodes
Rhodes’ new book is the first in publisher Quercus Books’ Little Book of Life Skills series
 It manages to tap into something pervasive, even romantic in the Western zeitgeist - becoming better, more skilled, more cultured and accomplished versions of ourselves - whilst never deviating from the integrity of a tradition that has remained essentially unchanged since humans first started making music on keyboards hundreds of years ago
 “Learning a musical instrument can unlock the door to a new dimension that many of us have forgotten even exists,” Rhodes begins in his opening chapter, and there is no denying the immense appeal of laying aside technology to engage one’s fingers and brain and soul in a pursuit that has nothing to do with email, texting, or social media
His project offers perhaps the ultimate digital detox
 Reading the book, I had fantasies of lighting a few candles of an evening, pouring a large glass of wine and getting stuck in to my piano practice: an alluring act of hygge, artistic self-improvement and self-care all in one
 If you’d told me as a kid that I’d one day actually look forward to practising the piano, I would have laughed in disbelief
 But in Rhodes’ witty, engaging, unpretentious hands, the prospect of daily piano-practice and its requirement of deep concentration becomes both meditation and medication

“We live in an age of such instant gratification, we’re always looking outside of ourselves, and I think we’ve lost sight of just doing something quiet for ourselves,” he offers, when I suggest that the book is also a timely reflection of a modern Western aspiration not to material wealth but to spiritual and emotional enrichment, as seen in the proliferation of on- and offline adult skills courses such as those offered by Skillshare, Creative Live and The School of Life
“Not for the reward but just for the sheer loveliness of doing it
 I think of playing the piano as a version of mindfulness - for which you don’t need a fleet of commando-style, shaven-haired monks, you just need a keyboard
” Besides, have we ever needed analogue escape routes more than now
 Rhodes agrees
 “All the news is bad, so why not just do something lovely for ourselves
”
Ditch the scales
Besides, learning - or re-learning - a skill such as playing the piano is proven to be good for our brains
 According to research from the University of Texas, “mentally-challenging leisure activities” can re-wire our grey matter, restoring our brains to a more “youth-like” state
 Rhodes is careful not to over-promise
 “Look, this book won’t have you playing Rachmaninov or Chopin etudes
 I was well aware that if you set out with a book about learning to play the piano and you say it takes 10,000 hours, nobody’s going to do it, because for whatever reason, good or bad, it has become hard to find time to simply focus and work on something for yourself
 Time is such a precious commodity
 But it will have you playing some Bach
 And the Bach is still challenging, it will still push you, but it’s as accessible as possible
” He continues
 “And six weeks is an outsize estimate: if you have time to practise more, or you played a lot as a kid, it will come back quicker
 And it will give you a proper insight into the music
 Maybe that in itself will be enough, or maybe you’ll enjoy it so much you’ll decide to get a teacher and learn other things
”

Find a piece you love, and work on it through the music - James Rhodes
Central to his approach is the beauty of the actual music itself
 “I’m a big fan of taking a piece that you want to play and finding a positive way to work at it, not through scales and etudes and exercises, but by simply playing it,” he explains
 The book breaks down exactly how to practise in this way, including his genius fingerings, which staves off the potential boredom and frustration that would lead many of us to give up
 I tell him I could never face doing scales and arpeggios as a child and I feel no differently about them as an adult

Rhodes encourages learners to ditch the scales and work through a piece of music that they love (Credit: Jeff Morgan / Alamy)
“Arpeggios and scales are never necessary
” he insists
 “In any piece there will be technical challenges that you can work on using the music itself
 I also loathe doing scales and arpeggios, but hey, I’m looking at this Mozart concerto that’s sitting on my piano right now, and it’s filled with scales and arpeggios
 If you’re working on a piece and achieving something, it’s a great way to learn
 Find a piece you love, and work on it through the music
”
Rhodes is evangelical about the joys of connecting or reconnecting with the piano, and beyond the book itself, his website has tutorials and videos dedicated to help you on your journey
 The start of a new year, with all its attendant resolve, seems as good a time as any to take the plunge; our lives, after all, are not getting any longer
 “Yeah
 We’re not going to be lying on our death bed thinking, I wish I’d sent a few more emails and done a few more spreadsheets,” he jokes
 “But you might well think: I wish I’d written that novel or painted that picture
 Or learned to play that piece of Bach on the piano…”A month ago, La La Land made history at the Golden Globes by being the first film to win seven trophies, so it’s no surprise that Damien Chazelle’s twinkly Los Angeles musical has had more than its fair share of Oscar nominations, too
 With nods in just about every conceivable category, including not one but two for best original song, it has a total of 14 nominations, thus matching the record held by All About Eve and Titanic
Inevitably, a backlash is already well underway, not just because some people haven’t gone gaga for La La Land, but because they consider it thin and flimsy enough to float off into the air, as its characters do when they visit the Griffith Observatory
 “In light of last year’s #oscarssowhite controversy,” went one article in The Economist, “many will feel that this year’s attention and critical adulation rightfully belong to more socially and politically minded fare like Moonlight, Loving and Birth of a Nation
”
Best picture winners typically deal with the horrors of child abuse, slavery, war and poverty
It is an understandable reaction
 Next to Moonlight, Hidden Figures and Fences, all of which are best picture nominees, La La Land doesn’t look too progressive
 But that doesn’t mean that it is a cowardly or obvious choice for Oscar voters
 The very fact that it doesn’t have an overt political message, but is still good enough to beguile awards bodies, is what makes La La Land so unusual

This year’s nominees are an impressively diverse bunch, with a lot more indie curios than there used to be in the line-up
 But what hasn’t changed is that the Academy is still pulled in by the gravity of weighty dramas about serious issues
 Best picture winners typically deal with the horrors of child abuse (Spotlight), slavery (12 Years a Slave), war (The Hurt Locker) and poverty (Slumdog Millionaire)
 Even Birdman and The Artist, the most showbizzy modern winners, plunged their heroes into valleys of depression and alienation
 In comparison, the healthy, attractive, gifted young dreamers in La La Land don’t have much to complain about
 But that’s why the film is so remarkable and even radical in terms of its award-season success
 At heart it is a romantic comedy - and romantic comedies are hardly Oscar bait
No jokes please
The last one to win a best picture prize was Annie Hall in 1978
 Since then, they have scarcely been nominated
 Four Weddings and a Funeral was on the best picture shortlist in 1995
 Broadening the definition of the genre slightly, we can include Jerry Maguire in 1997 and As Good As It Gets in 1998 - not that either of them was ever a favourite
 Over the subsequent two decades, the Oscars have pretty much ignored the rom-com, despite the shortlist being expanded to fit in a potential 10 contenders in 2010
 (The Artist almost qualifies, but that was more of a melodrama, and its heroine was very much a supporting character
)

The Academy has long been notorious for neglecting romantic comedies - and all comedies
 As Jack Black joked at the 2008 ceremony, the only way for a comedian to win an Oscar is to switch to drama
 “I’m gonna re-read that script about the guy who gets lead poisoning and then sues a major corporation,” he raved
 “There’s not a laugh in there
” But, the Academy’s prejudice aside, it’s also apparent that Hollywood romantic comedies have been in decline since the 1990s
Try to think of a recent rom-com that has been uplifting and un-ironic, without also being nauseating, and you’ll appreciate how special La La Land is
Co-incidentally, Gosling must take some of the blame
 Ever since he stole a zillion hearts in The Notebook in 2004, the standard film about star-crossed lovers has been a soggy adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel, featuring at least one cancer patient
 Directors who want some comedy with their romance, meanwhile, have tended to follow the lead of the Farrelly Brothers, who equate love with physical pain and public humiliation, and Judd Apatow, who sees courtship as something to be squeezed between sessions of sweary bromantic bonding
 Try to think of a recent boy-meets-girl comedy, which has been uplifting and un-ironic, without also being nauseating, and you’ll appreciate how special La La Land is
In the dance of attraction and flirtation that comprises the film’s first half, it doesn’t put a foot wrong
 Chazelle introduces Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, and Seb (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist, when they exchange hostile glares in the opening traffic jam
 A while later, Mia is enchanted by Seb’s ivory-tinkling in a restaurant, but he is so upset about being fired that he barges past her and disappears into the street
La La Land inline

By this stage in the average 21st-Century romantic comedy, the lead characters would have got drunk, had sex and then moaned to their respective buddies that they had made an embarrassing mistake
 But Chazelle uses the film’s first act to establish Mia and Seb’s individual careers and passions
 When they finally get around to having a conversation, the audience is primed and ready for them to fall in love
 And even then, the pacing has a relaxed, breezy confidence
There is the delicious scene in which Mia taunts Seb at a pool party as he plays in an ‘80s cover band, her sarcastic enthusiasm echoed satisfyingly when she dances to his jazz improvisation later on
 There is the twilit drift back to their cars after the party, the getting-to-know-you stroll through a Hollywood backlot, the cinema date Mia almost misses, and, at last, the Griffith Observatory nocturne
 To quote Judd Apatow: “When comedies work, they feel effortless, so people think misery is harder to create
” The old-fashioned relationship in La La Land does feel effortless
 But if it wasn’t hard, how come nobody except Chazelle is creating anything like it
Gosling and Stone 
The key to the actors' chemistry is their contrasting acting styles - one aloof, the other emotional (Credit: Lionsgate)
One piece of luck was that the lead actors he initially cast, Emma Watson and Miles Teller, dropped out, clearing the way for the sheer likeability and easy compatibility of Stone and Gosling, who had already starred opposite each other in Gangster Squad and Crazy, Stupid, Love
 The key to their chemistry - apart from their industrial quantities of charm - is their sharply contrasting acting styles
 Stone’s emotions pour out of her
 Whether Mia is angry or elated, her feelings are written all over her face, and not just on those massive eyes
 Gosling, one of Hollywood’s most magnetic underplayers, prefers to restrict himself to a smirk or a raised eyebrow, and it’s this imbalance that has the viewer desperate for Seb to be as open and generous as Mia is
There is more to La La Land than the way the actors and the characters connect, of course
 It got those 14 Oscar nominations for its flowing camerawork, the Pop Art brightness of its costumes and production design, and the toe-tapping songs by Justin Hurwitz
 But it’s the magic in that buoyant first hour that makes it worthy of the awards it has been and will be given: the magic of an exquisitely constructed comedy about two people who make beautiful music together
There’s no denying that Cynthia Nixon looks the part as Emily Dickinson, star of Terence Davies’ stunning new film A Quiet Passion
 It’s not just the way she wears her hair – that emphatic central parting, the braided bun – or the ribbon round her neck
 The actress seems to share something of the poet’s facial features too
 But in other respects, Nixon’s portrayal is full of surprises
 You can see it even in the trailer, in which Dickinson and her mischievous proto-feminist friend, Vryling Buffam, eye up men while fluttering their fans
 Is this Dickinson or Sex and the City’s Miranda Hobbes in olden days’ garb
 It certainly isn’t how you’d imagine literature’s most famous recluse conducting herself
The cult of the 19th-Century American poet has coalesced around a very precise image, one that tells us a lot about how we view poets and how we view women poets in particular
 It’s pieced together from the most outlandish details of Dickinson’s biography: her penchant for dressing in white, her reluctance to leave her bedroom, her habit of addressing visitors through a door rather than face to face
Cynthia Nixon as Emily Dickinson

It seems to have taken hold almost as soon as her poems found their audience
 Though Dickinson wrote nearly 1,800 poems, just 10 were printed during her lifetime
 Significant publication came only after her death, aged 55, in 1886, at which point her work immediately attracted an ardent fan base
 Women readers were especially devoted, and started to make pilgrimages to the Homestead, the Dickinson’s home in Amherst, Massachusetts, which is now a museum
 Since then, the idea that such poems could have been penned by a secluded spinster toiling in recluse has proven irresistible – especially to generations of gauche, overwrought teenagers
 As Nixon puts it, Dickinson is the “patron saint of shy persons”
 It’s only part of the story, however, and Davies’ film is just one of a series of creative projects seeking to show other sides of Emily Dickinson
Truth told slant
“We were taught that she was this reclusive spinster who lived with her family, dressed all in white, and wrote in her room all day”, recalls artist Rosanna Bruno of her high school introduction to the poet in the 1980s
 Even then, Bruno felt that the mythology of the poet didn’t really mesh with the poems
 “It seemed so incongruous to what she wrote”, she says
 “Have you ever heard Helen Mirren reading Wild Nights
 You really have to rethink Dickinson as a reclusive spinster after that rendition
” 
A new book imagines Dickinson’s OKCupid profile: ‘Ethnicity: white as alabaster’
Bruno drew a cartoon of one of Dickinson’s best-known poems, Because I could not stop for Death, and when she found herself reading Dickinson’s work again while on a fellowship at the Yaddo artists’ colony in Saratoga Springs more than 20 years later, more drawings came
 The result is The Slanted Life of Emily Dickinson, a graphic novel that offers speculative glimpses of Dickinson’s social media feeds, and is published in March

Among cartoons that imagine Dickinson’s Instagram account (“@recluse1830”) and OKCupid profile (“ethnicity: white as alabaster”) are fake scholarly tomes whose titles send up our fascination with Dickinson’s personal life: Her Daily Bread: Emily Dickinson’s Silent Struggle with Gluten Intolerance, and Emily Wiccanson: The Poet and Her ‘Craft’, exploring her possible involvement in witchcraft
It’s not true that she lived in a vacuum – Carolyn Vega
Dickinson the social media star may be the stuff of satire, but as a young woman, the poet was indeed socially active
 Even later in life, she maintained and formed new friendships through her correspondence, some of which is currently on show in New York at the Morgan Library’s exhibition I’m Nobody
 Who Are You
 The Life and Poetry of Emily Dickinson
 (An accompanying program of events features a reading and recital by Patti Smith and her pianist daughter
) Its curator, Carolyn Vega, is a long-time Dickinson fan
 “While it is true that she did retreat from society, it is also true that she was deeply connected to her world through family, friendships, and literary mentors and editors
 She also read widely and was aware of political realities, including the American Civil War, that were going on around her
 It is not true that she lived in a vacuum”, Vega says
 Nor did Dickinson write in one: as the exhibition shows, she also sent out hundreds of poems to a coterie of carefully chosen friends and editors
 “She was not shy or reticent about sharing her work with them
”

To the extent that she did later opt for physical isolation, it would be a mistake to read timidity into that choice
 As Paul Hetherington, a Dickinson expert and professor of writing at the University of Canberra, notes: ‘The image of her as being a reclusive eccentric overshadows, and skews our reading of her work because it separates her from the mainstream and casts her in the role of perennial bridesmaid, unsuited to a more robust life and always working at the margins”
 In fact, he says, holing up in her father’s comfy home gave her licence, in a staunchly patriarchal society, “to speak openly about love, desire and various ideas of devotion in a way countenanced by no other 19th-Century writer
 She is in this way perhaps the first truly modern poet in the English language
”
‘Poster girl’
Writer and academic Dr Cassandra Atherton agrees
 “Dickinson’s mythology is often misread by scholars and teachers
 Far from being trapped in her father’s house, she was a subversive and brilliant poet whose rebellion can be seen in her battle against patriarchal society and its attempted containment of her as an intellectual female
”
Like Bruno and Vega, Atherton was an early convert to Dickinson’s poetry
 “Emily Dickinson was my poster girl”, she says of her teen self
 She would even go to school dressed in white with her hair parted and pulled back like the poet
 “Dickinson was a fierce observer – a role in which I felt cast as a teenager, and she took up themes concerning the importance of self, as well as pain and suffering, love and death, all essential to my experience growing up
” That infatuation hasn’t waned with adulthood – she even owns (and uses) an Emily Dickinson cookie cutter
A constructed public image can wholly obscure the true meaning of an artist’s work – Madeleine Olnek
For others, the myth is off-putting
 Playwright and film-maker Madeleine Olnek lost all interest after hearing in middle school that Dickinson was agoraphobic
 As a single university graduate, she’d tell anyone who asked that she hoped to become “the Emily Dickinson of comedy” – the joke being that Dickinson wasn’t funny
 Or so she thought
 “Later, when I started researching her, I was very, very surprised to learn that she was funny – things she said were laugh out loud funny
 And she wrote very funny things too,” she says
 “It was fascinating to me as a writer that the truth of Emily Dickinson’s life was so different [from] what the world was told about her
 This struck me as a story about the marketing of an artist, and how a constructed public image can wholly obscure the true meaning of an artist’s work
”

 is a poem first published in 1891, shown here in Dickinson’s own hand (Credit: Houghton Library, Harvard University)
Olnek has already had a play about Dickinson staged, and a film is currently in production, scheduled to wrap by early 2018
 “I don’t want to give too much away, but the movie explores the meaningful relationships that Emily forged and maintained throughout her life
 She’s always been portrayed as a loner who never came out of her room, but in fact she had loving and satisfying relationships,” she says
 It’s a drama with comic moments and Dickinson is played by none other than Saturday Night Live’s Molly Shannon
 “Molly is a performer who is sui generis, with a quick, lively mind, just like Dickinson herself
 It took a lot of nerve to write poems, to put your mind on paper – especially in the way Dickinson did, so far ahead of her time she was creating new forms – there’s an audacity to it, a subversiveness, and a willingness to cross boundaries
”
Olnek’s research, which is funded by a Guggenheim fellowship, was inspired by the use of infrared technology to access crossed out and erased words in Dickinson’s papers
 Much of this heavy editing is the work of Mabel Todd, the mistress of Dickinson’s brother, Austin
 In particular, Todd was keen to delete mentions of Dickinson’s friend – and possibly more, according to Olnek – Susan Gilbert, who also happened to be Austin’s wife
Tantalising though these discoveries are, they’re also a reminder to stick with what Dickinson left behind: her words
 And what words they are
 They’re perhaps best summed up by a quote that the Morgan Library’s Vega likes to offer from one of Dickinson’s own letters: “If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know thatis poetry
”When Reservoir Dogs premiered 25 years ago, audiences at the Sundance Film Festival saw a low-budget indie movie about some men arguing in a warehouse, with no big stars and an unknown writer-director
 And yet Quentin Tarantino’s bravura debut had the impact of a zillion-dollar blockbuster
 Film fans everywhere were soon debating its back-and-forth chronology, its zinging banter, its ultra-cool 1970s soundtrack, and, most of all, its supposedly excessive violence
 After Wes Craven, the director of A Nightmare on Elm Street, walked out of one festival screening in disgust, Reservoir Dogs became a byword for cinematic gore
“Strong violence is Tarantino’s passion,” wrote Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times, “and he embraces it with gleeful, almost religious, fervor
 An energetic macho stunt, Reservoir Dogs glories in its excesses of blood and profanity, delighting, in classic Grand Guignol fashion, in going as far over the top as the man’s imagination will take it
”

This response isn’t entirely unjustified
 After a quarter of a century, it’s still chilling to see the psychopathic Mr Blonde (Michael Madsen) slashing a policeman’s face and severing his ear, shimmying all the while to Stealers Wheel’s Stuck in the Middle with You
 But, minute by minute, Reservoir Dogs is hardly a violent film: it has a lot more talking than ear-lopping
 Nor is the violence particularly explicit
Reservoir Dogs isn’t just more restrained than a standard Hollywood thriller – it’s also far more moral
As Tarantino said to Rolling Stone magazine, “Go to a video store and nine out of 10 films in the action-adventure section are more graphic than mine
” When Mr Blonde gives the unfortunate policeman the Vincent van Gogh treatment, for instance, the camera tilts away, leaving the viewer to swear that they’ve seen a razor blade hacking through flesh even though – as with Psycho three decades earlier – the butchery is all in their own imagination
Reservoir Dogs isn’t just more restrained than a standard Hollywood thriller, though
 It’s also far more moral
 Whereas most hold-up capers let their protagonists get away with murder, this is one in which crime doesn’t pay, violence doesn’t solve nothing, and the cockiest crooks are revealed to be cowardly bunglers
 It even insists that anyone who kills someone should end up being killed themselves
 There are Sunday school sermons that are more ambiguous about the wages of sin

The film’s high-mindedness is apparent in its opening scenes
 First, we see a group of sharp-suited career criminals sitting around a diner table and chatting about everything except the diamond robbery they’re planning to commit: an old address book; the etiquette of tipping; the meaning of Madonna’s Like a Virgin
 After seven minutes of this repartee, we see the criminals strolling in slow-motion through the Los Angeles sunshine, while The George Baker Selection’s finger-clicking Little Green Bag sets the mood
 With an iconic sequence that has inspired the dress code of a million stag nights, Tarantino persuades us that we’re about to see a heist being pulled off to perfection by the coolest dudes since the Rat Pack starred in Ocean’s Eleven
Arrested development
But it’s all a trick
 Even before Little Green Bag has finished, we start to hear agonised gasps and whimpers, and the next thing we see is a terrified Mr Orange (Tim Roth) bleeding all over the back seat of a car driven by his panicky colleague, Mr White (Harvey Keitel)
 Tarantino doesn’t glamourise his anti-heroes’ profession by showing them swaggering in and out of the jewellery store they’re sticking-up; he only shows us the messy, painful and humiliating aftermath of their botched job
 Black suits and snappy dialogue notwithstanding, Reservoir Dogs wastes no time in establishing that its characters are losers, one and all
 The rest of the film bears this out
Reservoir Dogs

The laidback Mr Blonde is so unstable that he goes on a rampage at the first sign of trouble
 The intrepid Mr Orange mewls about how scared he is after being shot in the stomach
 Mr White, a supposedly hardened veteran, is so easily fooled by an undercover cop that he tells him his name and his home city
 The film’s wittiest inversion is that the whiny, weaselly and altogether Steve Buscemi-ish Mr Pink (Steve Buscemi) turns out to be the most competent of the lot
 He is the one who keeps hold of a bag of diamonds, who realises that one of his colleagues must be working with the police, and who breaks up a fight between Messrs White and Blonde
 “What, are we in the playground here
” he demands, the answer being, yes, that’s exactly where they are
 With their silly code-names and matching outfits, their puerile insults and their giggly wrestling matches, the Reservoir Dogs are nothing but big kids
It isn’t really a film about cops and robbers
 It’s really a film about geeks
For better or worse, one of the most influential aspects of the film is the way its characters wax lyrical about their favourite films, TV shows and songs
 You’re never more than a minute away from a crack about Lee Marvin, Pam Grier or the Fantastic Four - and even the grizzled Mr Blue (Eddie Bunker) has an opinion about Madonna
 But while Tarantino’s many imitators resort to pop-cultural chit-chat because they can’t think of anything else for their characters to talk about, Tarantino uses it for a reason: to remind us that we are watching a bunch of arrested adolescents
 That could be why Reservoir Dogs is so cherished by nerdy music-and-movie obsessives (me included)
 It isn’t really a film about cops and robbers
 It’s really a film about geeks
Diner

More specifically, it’s a film about male geeks
 Tarantino would go onto write substantial roles for Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, and for Pam Grier in Jackie Brown, but in Reservoir Dogs there isn’t a single line of dialogue spoken by a woman
 And whenever women are mentioned - as in a sniggering anecdote about a waitress who glued her abusive husband’s penis to his stomach - it sounds like the misogynistic locker-room gossip of boys who have never plucked up the courage to speak to a real live girl
 It’s true that Mr White reminisces about a female associate called Alabama (presumably the Alabama played by Patricia Arquette in the Tarantino-scripted True Romance), but he claims that their partnership couldn’t last: “You push that woman-man thing too long and it gets to you after a while
” That sums it up
 The characters like to view themselves as fearless gangsters
 But at heart they are teenagers stuck in their parents’ basements
 None of them is mature enough to handle “that woman-man thing”
Perhaps that’s why Tarantino chose to open the film with his riff on Madonna’s Like a Virgin; the men around the diner table – juvenile, volatile, afraid of women – might as well be hormonal virgins themselves
 And perhaps that’s why, when Mr Orange recites a story about his stint as a drug dealer, his main complaint is that people kept ringing him while he was trying to watch The Lost Boys
 Consciously or not, Tarantino may have chosen this title because that is what the characters are
 His Reservoir Dogs aren’t goodfellas or wise guys, but boys who never grew up
In a Berlin art gallery, a battle rages
 The carelessly beautiful line of a melancholy harlequin’s dangling leg does war with the impudent scratchiness of a goggle-eyed naked couple caught – and the word is chosen deliberately – humping
 Beside that, the fine-featured translucence of a delicate portrait from the most famous Blue Period of them all, bravely faces a grotesque, grey-faced preacher with hair in the style of Charles II or Brian May
 In another room, a small, kitschy image of Queen Elizabeth II in pastel hat and pearls is forced to look on in blandly smiling approbation at a massive Cubist nude, all breasts and pudenda and underarm hair like starfishes
The more you look between the two, the more strained Her Majesty’s smile begins to seem
The exhibition feels like it was designed to annoy the more elitist element within the art world
This is Confrontation, an exhibition at Berlin’s Museum Berggruen, in which the paintings of contemporary US artist George Condo hang alongside the museum’s own hugely impressive collection of works by modernist pioneers Matisse, Klee, Braque, Cezanne and, most numerously, Picasso
(Credit: George Condo)
Condo regularly assails the boundaries of good taste, drawing upon pop culture such as in Telepoche Cut-Out with its imagery from Wheel of Fortune (Credit: George Condo)
And the effect of walking through these immaculate rooms with their carefully curated pairings is little short of revelatory, especially for those of us who would hesitate to call ourselves fine-arts aficionados
 In fact there is a very real sense that the exhibition might have been designed precisely to annoy, or in the parlance of the catalogue, at least "irritate" the more elitist element within the already rarefied art world
 Partly that’s because Confrontation can be enjoyed with a bare minimum of outside knowledge – take it from me
 And partly because it’s so damn funny
(Credit: George Condo)
Condo also frequently subverts sacred symbols or images of authority, as in Woman with Cross (Credit: George Condo)
"It’s very rare, in that it’s so playful, so full of humour," the exhibition’s curator, and the director of Berlin’s National Gallery, Udo Kittelmann tells me
 "There’s this wonderful Picasso portrait of a woman, and next to it you have this very small picture by Condo titled The Sex Addict – and, my goodness
" Like many of the Condo paintings on display, The Sex Addict seems not just to be an homage to the work it hangs beside, but naughtily mimicking it, sticking its tongue out and pulling faces
 But the raspberry it’s blowing is not at the painting itself, for which Condo’s admiration somehow shines through
 It feels aimed instead at those who would regard the Picasso as unassailable, as beyond the pale of pastiche or interrogation, locked forever in the sterile cabinet marked ‘masterpiece’
The status of Picasso’s painting as canonized masterworks can impair one from seeing them as shocking as they are
"The only reason Condo could create this body of work," explains Kittelmann, "is that he was never afraid to deal with these 'superheroes' of art
 Today most people are afraid
" As you move through the exhibition, admiration for Condo’s lack of fear gives way to amusement at his insolence, and a deliciously subversive sense that he, and we, are getting away with it
 Kittelmann agrees: "You start with a smile, and finally you laugh
"
High meets low
The confrontations are not just funny, they are also rejuvenating
 You wander the rooms without experiencing the gallery fatigue associated with more traditional shows, which philistines like me often only remember as a blur of paint on canvas and an urgent curiosity about the bill of fare in the adjoining cafe
 Here, the mischievous aesthetic conflicts keep you constantly off-balance, constantly recalibrating your expectations, constantly engaged, and your attention never wanders to tea and cake
(Credit: Pablo Picasso)
Picasso also made confrontation his theme – his African mask-wearing prostitutes staring directly at the viewer seem to demand a response (Credit: Pablo Picasso)
Kittelmann explains, "What George [Condo] and I had in mind was, through these paintings, to make people remember how it would have been in1910, 1912, 1913, when they first saw Picasso’s Cubist paintings – it was a shock
" Now, of course, those images are among the most famous in the fine art world, but their status as canonised masterworks can impair the casual viewer’s ability to see them for the striking, profound images they are
 "Today," says Kittelmann, "[a lot of] people who go to exhibitions see a Picasso and they say: 'look, another painting
 Probably worth a million
' This does not happen at all here
 It’s always about the power of the art itself, the power of the image
"

Hanging the delightfully rude paintings of Condo next to the Matisses, Braques and Picassos that, along with an intervening century’s worth of pop culture, inspired him, was calculated to elevate the estimation of Condo’s talents
 Any artist who shares wall space with these "superheroes" surely gets an upward nudge – even if their work seems wanting in comparison, or even if the "invasion" of the museum’s pristine collection causes "irritation"
 But, "what really happens, and this we could not be sure of [in advance]," says Kittelmann, "Condo’s paintings refresh the 'superhero' paintings and not just the other way around
 You see both works totally differently
  The paintings do not change, but our way of seeing them does
"
Reverse snobbery is just another form of snobbery, after all – it’s a peril at any brow-level
Condo’s work gives Picasso’s art back to the viewer, as much as Picasso dignifies Condo by association, and this to-and-fro relationship happens in a way that tears into the discrete, categorical separations that foster an exclusionary, alienating approach to art
 And that is an approach that dogs not just the highbrow ‘elite’ but their nominal opposites: the populists who would also reject whole classes of art and culture, sight unseen, believing them to be outside their realm of interest
 Reverse snobbery is just another form of snobbery, after all – it’s a peril at any brow-level – and corrosive tides of partisanship along left wing/right wing, liberal/conservative, populist/elitist divides are rising not just in global political discourse, but in the cultural discussion too
 As a film critic, I’ve felt it pollute the air in my own small corner of society
Shattering hierarchies
Which is why the giddy blast of Confrontation, an exhibition that demands not passive consumption but active participation, that challenges traditional divisions between high and low art and that has such a good time doing it, has such a salutary, oxygenating effect
 Perhaps it’s a factor of being outside my own cultural comfort zone – itself a lesson about getting out of one’s silo – but the Confrontation approach feels exponentially bigger than the exhibition itself
 "But yes
" exclaims Kittelmann when I ask him if the thinking behind Confrontation could have a similarly energising effect across the broader cultural landscape
 "You can do this with every kind of art – paintings, sculpture, film, music…"
(Credit: Condo/Berggreun Museum)
The parallels between Condo and Picasso are particularly obvious in Condo’s The Cracked Cardinal with its Cubism and anti-clericism (Credit: Condo/Berggreun Museum)
In the context of an increasingly unstable world, it can be easy to fall prey to paralysis regarding art; it can all seem so futile, so much pretty fiddling while Rome burns
 But the exothermic, oppositional approach of Confrontation has, among all its other pleasures, the effect of reminding us how vital art is, how personal and yet how much an expression of participation in our collective humanity it is
 Udo Kittelmann’s grand, but not unjustified hope for the exhibition is that it could "get back to the real roots of why art is with us – why art was invented
"
In an airy room, a pair of strangers come at the same time to Picasso’s graceful Seated Harlequin with Red Background (1905) then look over at the grinning goblins of Condo’s Seated Couple (2005)
 They glance at each other and laugh
 It’s the final lovely irony of an exhibition laden with irony that outside its doors the world is more divided than ever yet its conflicts and confrontations evince, of all things, solidarity
In 1888, a radical young painter called Georges Seurat submitted an imposing canvas to the fourth Salon des Indepéndants, an annual exhibition in the French capital showcasing revolutionary art
 It was a nocturnal scene, depicting a troupe of musicians attempting to entice passers-by to roll up, roll up, and buy tickets for a travelling circus
In the middle, on a pedestal, beneath a row of gas jets that illuminate the scene, a trombonist wearing conical headgear plays his instrument, supported by four ragtag musicians in bowler hats
 To the right, beside a buffoonish entertainer with a slicked-up quiff, a haughty ringmaster, with a puffed-out chest and impressive moustache, surveys the action
 Beneath them, members of the public, seen in silhouette, watch the show
Suerat's Circus Sideshow

Seurat probably encountered a scene just like this in the spring of 1887, when the travelling Corvi Circus set up at the Gingerbread Fair held annually on the outskirts of Paris
 Strangely, though, given the raucous nature of his subject, with loud music and a crowd of jostling onlookers, Seurat imbued the finished painting with a restrained, stately air
 More than a century after it was created, Circus Sideshow (1887-88) remains a haunting and mysterious work of art
Before the advent of cinema, the circus was one of the most popular forms of mass entertainment
 A new exhibition, Seurat’s Circus Sideshow, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, places this masterpiece in context – beside related studies as well as works by other 19th-Century artists tackling the same theme
 And it leaves us in no doubt that Seurat was far from the only modern artist fascinated by the circus

In fact, if we consider the development of modern art, it quickly becomes apparent that, like Seurat, artists from Renoir and Degas to Picasso and Matisse all felt compelled to depict the circus
To understand why, we must cast our minds back to a time, before the advent of cinema, when the circus was one of the most popular forms of mass entertainment, alongside the café-concert (the French equivalent of the music hall)
In on the act
“Absolutely everybody went to the circus,” says Richard Thomson, professor of fine art at the University of Edinburgh, and guest curator of Seurat’s Circus Sideshow at the Met
 “Working-class people went to the travelling fairs, which came on a regular basis and were very cheap
 But there were also chic circuses
 There was a circus in Paris in the 1880s, called the Cirque Molier, which was really for society people – one of the acrobats was the Duke de La Rochefoucauld
 He performed a trapeze act with an artist called Theo Wagner, who had been at the École des Beaux-Arts, the art school in Paris, with Seurat
 It was extremely fashionable
”
On a straightforward level, the appeal of the circus for artists needs little explanation: all those tumblers and clowns in bright costumes offered painters a rich, ready-made subject full of dynamism and drama
 “Artists have always been interested in the circus, because, as a visual spectacle, it’s very exciting,” explains Thomson
The Met’s show demonstrates that, long before Seurat, caricaturists such as Daumier were getting in on the act
 Like Seurat, Daumier depicted the circus ‘parade’ (or sideshow) – a temporary structure, erected outside the big top, on which acrobats and musicians performed excerpts of their acts for free, to drum up business
Honoré Daumier’s The Sideshow

Daumier drew parallels between saltimbanques – the French word for circus performers, derived from the Italian saltimbanco (someone who jumps on a bench) – and politicians, who were similarly desperate to catch the interest (and, in their case, votes) of the masses
But other factors, beyond simple spectacle, contributed to the appeal of the circus for modern artists
 “Their fascination was varied and complex,” explains Thomson, “but one aspect was that the circus was constantly changing
”
Since the Middle Ages, the circus had been an integral part of time-honoured travelling fairs, which were deeply embedded in French culture
 Beginning in the 1860s, though, impresarios in Paris and elsewhere began to capitalise on the increasing popularity of the circus by erecting permanent rings, with fixed seating
The circus' association with melancholy and alienation stirred a generation of artists 
“Circuses needed to present new spectacles to keep the punters coming in,” explains Thomson
 “And that sense of modern momentum and need for change and innovation – of being on the edge, being up to date – attracted artists who were conscious of their own modernity, and interested in the spectacle of modernity, such as Renoir and Degas
”
In 1879, for instance, Renoir painted two young female acrobats at the Cirque Fernando, a Parisian circus founded four years earlier, and situated in a working-class area at the foot of the hill of Montmartre, not far from other places of popular entertainment such as the Moulin Rouge
Miss Lala

Degas, too, frequented the Cirque Fernando
 Also in 1879, he painted one of its most sensational acts, involving an acrobat known as Miss La La, who was pulled up to the rafters of the circus dome by a rope clenched between her teeth
 The painting’s vertiginous composition, looking upwards at the acrobat, who hangs precariously in mid-air, is striking and original
“It’s a marvellous painting,” says Thomson
 “But also, I think, something of a pun – because by drawing attention to this figure going upwards, it’s like a religious painting of the Ascension
 So, it’s a bit of a joke at the expense of pious imagery from the past
”
Clowning around
While the innovations of the modern circus excited artists associated with Impressionism, such as Renoir and Degas, other aspects – chiefly, its association with melancholy and alienation – stirred the generation of artists that followed them, including Seurat
 (In 1891, Seurat died suddenly, at the age of 31, leaving behind another major, albeit unfinished, scene filled with circus entertainers
)
By way of example, Thomson mentions a group of crayon and chalk drawings of circus figures that Toulouse-Lautrec produced while undergoing treatment for alcoholism at a sanatorium on the edge of Paris in 1899
 “He made them from memory, to try and prove his mental stability,” Thomson says
 “And some of them have a slightly nightmarish quality, because they were drawn by a man who was not well
”
Moreover, by the end of the 19th Century, the notion of the sad clown was a firmly established trope
 This idea stretched all the way back to Watteau’s ambiguous 18th-Century painting of a wan and solitary Pierrot, a stock character from the Commedia dell’arte, imbued with a sense of pathos
Watteau’s Pierrot

Thomson explains: “There was a strong understanding of the myth of the sad clown – the clown or acrobat who does everything to entertain the public, and make them laugh, but is, himself, deep down inside, melancholy and alienated
”
Why was this myth so attractive for artists such as Seurat
 “Part of the fascination,” Thomson says, “was because travelling players lived on the edge
 They were people with no fixed abode, who were reliant on good weather and the goodwill of the public
 And being on the margins of society made them fragile
” He continues: “Artists identified with people on the edge of society
 The painter trying to sell work that the bourgeoisie wasn’t interested in was like a clown – doing his best to entertain, but not always succeeding
 So, circus performers became an equivalent for artists, who treated them almost autobiographically
”
Picasso’s Family of Saltimbanques 
The entertainers in Picasso’s Family of Saltimbanques are cast in a desolate landscape, a long way from the bright lights of the big top (Credit: Wikipedia)
Certainly, this is what we find in the Rose or ‘circus’ period paintings of Picasso, who also frequented the Cirque Medrano (as the Cirque Fernando was renamed around the turn of the 20th Century)
 Family of Saltimbanques (1905), for instance, is the masterpiece of Picasso’s series of paintings of melancholic itinerant circus performers, who function as symbols for the artist and his circle
 “These paintings go right back to the idea of the sad clown, and are very much about alienation and solitude,” Thomson says
Many other 20th-Century artists depicted the circus – among them Kees Van Dongen, Fernand Leger, and Georges Rouault, whose Sideshow (1907-10), is in the exhibition at the Met
 During the ‘20s, the American sculptor Alexander Calder also became enthralled by acrobats
 They inspired the Cirque Calder (1926-31) – a charming, miniaturised, mechanical sculpture-cum-replica of a circus, complete with acts including a bearded lady and a lion tamer that could ‘perform’ for an audience
 Calder travelled with this early example of performance art, which eventually filled five large suitcases
Plate from Matisse's Jazz 
Matisse’s book Jazz riffs on circus motifs and has been called “the closest thing to an autobiography that Matisse has left us” (Credit: Alamy)
One of the final flourishes of the circus as a subject in modern art, though, came in 1947, with the publication of Matisse’s spellbinding artist’s book, Jazz
 This contains 20 colour plates bursting with circus performers, including acrobats, trapeze artists, a high-wire walker, a knife-thrower, an equestrienne, a sword-swallower, a ringmaster, and a white elephant balancing on a ball
 Indeed, its original title was The Circus
In other words, Jazz – which one art historian has described as “the closest thing to an autobiography that Matisse has left us” – is a late but brilliant example of the traditional identification between artist and performer – with an additional, poignant twist: Matisse worked on the cut-paper designs for Jazz while convalescing after a life-threatening operation, which had left him an invalid in 1941
“How interesting that Matisse made Jazz right at the end of his life when he was physically frail,” says Thomson
 “And yet the imagery that he was dealing with was of gymnasts and vigorous movement
 So, ironically, given the wonderful colour of his images, there is a sense of regret and loss as well
 That double dimension – of joy and melancholy – is consistent throughout modern representations of the circus

It’s 25 years since The Silence of the Lambs became only the third film in history to win Oscars in five of the major categories: best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, best actress and best actor
 But it sometimes feels as if its diabolical anti-hero, Dr Hannibal ‘The Cannibal’ Lecter, has never been away
 Hopkins returned to the role that made him a superstar for two further films, Hannibal and Red Dragon; Gaspard Ulliel was Lecter’s younger incarnation in Hannibal Rising; and Mads Mikkelsen played him in the recent series Hannibal
 And that’s not counting all the Lecter clones in other films and television shows
(Credit: MGM)
With intense physicality and a sense of refined, unblinking madness Hopkins’ Lecter set the bar for onscreen insanity – despite only being in 16 minutes of the film (Credit: MGM)
The character may have been born in Thomas Harris’s novels, and he may have been brought to the screen by Brian Cox in 1986’s Manhunter, but it is Hopkins’ Silence of the Lambs interpretation that has been the template for dozens of other suave, sadistic, formidably brainy villains – and heroes, too
 Watch the scene in which he identifies skin cream and perfume brands by sniffing the air, and you can see where Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock Holmes came from
How many other Hollywood heroines – or heroes – are anything like Clarice
But maybe it’s about time we grew out of our Lecter fixation
 The psychotic psychiatrist is an extraordinary creation, written and performed with tremendous ghoulish panache, but ultimately he’s just another cartoon monster, with as much to do with reality as Count Dracula or Freddy Krueger
 His brave, quick-witted but vulnerable young sparring partner, Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster, is the more radical character in many ways
 And she still seems radical after a quarter of a century
(Credit: BBC/PBS)
The mixture of intelligence and madness that defined Lecter has inspired many copycat villains, and even heroes like Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock (Credit: BBC/PBS)
One striking aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is the care taken by its director, Jonathan Demme, and its screenwriter, Ted Tally, to establish Starling and her well-ordered world
 A trainee FBI agent, she pounds through the Bureau’s woodland assault course at the start of the film
 Demme goes on to stage several long scenes which were shot at the actual FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, so that we can see Starling’s colleagues doing their paperwork, practising their shooting, drinking their coffee
 Most films about law-enforcement agencies have maverick protagonists: agents who either break the rules (James Bond) or turn against their nefarious handlers (Jason Bourne)
 But Silence of the Lambs has a deep respect for the FBI’s methods, and so does Starling
 She isn’t a rebel
 She doesn’t rely on intuition or luck
 She is a clever, dedicated professional who succeeds by doing everything by the book and with the encouragement of her superiors
  How many other Hollywood heroines – or heroes – are anything like her
Boys’ club
When Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), the head of the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit, sends Starling to meet Lecter in his cell at the Baltimore Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Demme moves us from her ascetic domain to his rococo one, from meticulous authenticity to nightmarish fantasy, from detective thriller to horror movie
 In the process, Demme gives Lecter one of cinema’s all-time great introductions
 The hospital’s slimy director, Dr Chilton (Anthony Heald), recounts the stomach-turning story of how Lecter ate a nurse’s tongue, and he and Starling descend from modern offices, via staircases and corridors, into a shadowy subterranean dungeon
(Credit: MGM)
Most of the characters in The Silence of the Lambs stare at Clarice Starling at one point or another – the film is very much a commentary on the ‘male gaze’ (Credit: MGM)
We’re terrified of Lecter even before we see him – and Hopkins exceeds our expectations with his statue-like stance, his reptilian winks, his teasing, sing-song voice
 I’d defy anyone to get through his first scene without wishing the Plexiglass sheet between him and Starling was several inches thicker
Silence of the Lambs is a film about what it’s like for women to be stared at by men
Lecter is so electrifying, in fact, that it’s easy to overlook what a preening, immature bore he soon reveals himself to be
 He is, of course, a snob who wants everyone to know about his taste in fine wines and expensive shoes, but he also has the grubby one-track mind of an adolescent schoolboy trying to shock his teacher
 At his initial meeting with Starling, he speculates about her upbringing, and “all those tedious, sticky fumblings in the back seats of cars”
 At his second, he asks whether Crawford “wants you sexually”
 At the third, he drools over the thought of her being abused by her mother’s cousin
 “Did the rancher make you perform fellatio
” he leers
 “Did he sodomise you
” And then when he speaks to a US senator whose daughter has been kidnapped by another serial killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), Lecter again turns into a cheeky schoolboy, ranting about the effects of breast-feeding on her nipples
 He may not have seen a women in his eight years of incarceration, but that’s no excuse for his behaving like a tabloid gossip columnist
Role model
Starling isn’t fazed
 “That doesn’t interest me, Doctor,” she says in response to one of his prurient jibes, and she goes so far as to compare him to ‘Multiple’ Miggs, the madman in a neighbouring cell who flung semen at her
 She makes a fair point
 Lecter’s male chauvinism may surface in a more sophisticated form than his fellow inmate’s, but Demme and Tally leave us in no doubt that he has more in common with Miggs than he likes to think
It might have been healthier for society if Foster’s dogged agent became as famous as Lecter
This lasciviousness isn’t confined to the asylum’s patients, either
 The film keeps reiterating that, as a young woman trying to get on with her job, Starling has to put up with advances of various kinds from the men around her: the smarmy Dr Chilton, an entomologist she consults
 (Refreshingly, she doesn’t become involved with any of them
) Demme also includes a remarkable number of shots of Starling jogging or walking, purely to show the heads turning as she passes
 More than anything else, Silence of the Lambs is a film about what it’s like for women to be stared at by men
 It’s no accident that Buffalo Bill got started as a serial killer by spying on his female neighbour, or that in his climactic showdown with Starling, he is watching her through night-vision goggles
 Amazingly, Demme fashioned both a heart-stopping chiller and a militant feminist commentary on sexual harassment and the male gaze
(Credit: MGM)
Demme makes it clear how isolated Clarice is in the male-dominated world of the FBI, a sense of loneliness which makes viewers identify with her all the more (Credit: MGM)
The most decent man in the film is Crawford, Starling’s boss, who isn’t trying to get his protegée into bed, despite what Lecter may imagine
 But even he can slip into sexism
 After they’ve been to examine the body of Buffalo Bill’s latest victim, Starling upbraids him for belittling her in front of the local sheriffs
 “Cops look at you to see how to act,” she explains, as resolute with Crawford as she is with Lecter
 “It matters
” The film then cuts to a shot of Starling striding through a natural history museum surrounded by dinosaur skeletons, the suggestion being that while Crawford may be progressive compared to most men, compared to her he is a dinosaur
But that, as it turned out, was wishful thinking
 Demme and his team may have hoped to usher in a new age of intelligent, independent, inspiring Hollywood heroines, but instead it was haughty homicidal maniacs who caught the public imagination
 Misogynistic dinosaurs still roam the earth
 As for Starling, she did turn up in the sequel, Hannibal, but she was treated so shabbily that Demme, Tally and Foster all turned the project down
 In place of Foster in a tracksuit, she became Julianne Moore in a frontless evening dress, and instead of keeping her distance from Lecter, she was as enthralled by him as the rest of us are
 What a waste
 It’s obvious why Hopkins’ bloodthirsty gourmand became a Halloween staple, and why he topped the American Film Institute’s list of best-ever movie villains, but it might have been healthier for society if Foster’s dogged agent had taken off in the same way
 Today, you can see versions of Hannibal Lecter every time you switch on the television
 But there’s still only one Clarice Starling
The Oval Office is America’s frontal lobe
 It’s the place in the brain of a presidency where the world can witness the synapses of an administration snapping, its neurons firing – the space in which we assess its psychological motivations, see what makes it tick
 Photos of John F Kennedy’s children romping there, of a stiff Richard Nixon attempting to unwind with Elvis Presley, and of the Obamas boogieing with a spry centenarian, have all imprinted themselves onto the US national consciousness and helped shape the way we regard the cerebral spirit of an administration – how we assess its mental health

In the past, such glimpses into the sanctuary of executive power have been carefully choreographed, if not rare, and always designed to preserve the mystique of that simultaneously architectural and psychological space
 This week, however, a flurry of images taken in the Oval Office have been released, revealing how the Trump administration converts instinct into action
 One in particular has captured the public’s attention: a photo of the president, flanked by male advisers, inking into effect an order removing funding for international groups that perform or provide information on abortions
He is not the first Republican US President to reinstate the so-called Mexico City Policy, which Ronald Reagan first introduced in 1984; George W Bush did so in 2001 after Bill Clinton had overturned it in 1993
 Yet the boldness of Trump signing such a gender-sensitive decree unattended by a single female adviser two days after people across the globe gathered to march in protest against his perceived attitude towards women, seemed to many as audaciously defiant

Admirers of the new president, especially those opposed on moral grounds to facilitating abortion, will doubtless see the image as evidence of Trump’s unflinching determination to act even in the face of robust opposition
 Detractors, however, are likely to continue seeing the image, absent of any female counsel, as evidence of subverted democracy, as flagrantly obtuse to the perspective of those affected by the order as the American artist John Trumbull’s 1819 depiction of the signing of the Declaration of Independence
 That famous painting, which has featured on official US stamps and currency notes, proudly portrays scores of white men, including many slaveholders, un-ironically congratulating themselves on pronouncing the equality and “inalienable rights” of all people

Oxana Malaya, Ukraine, 1991Beautiful and disturbing at the same time, the images in Julia Fullerton-Batten’s latest project have a dreamlike, fairy-tale quality
 Yet the lives they portray are real
 “There are two different scenarios – one where the child ended up in the forest, and another where the child was actually at home, so neglected and abused that they found more comfort from animals than humans,” the photographer tells BBC Culture
 This image recreates the case of Ukrainian girl Oxana Malaya
 According to Fullerton-Batten, “Oxana was found living with dogs in a kennel in 1991
 She was eight years old and had lived with the dogs for six years
 Her parents were alcoholics and one night, they had left her outside
 Looking for warmth, the three-year-old crawled into the farm kennel and curled up with the mongrel dogs, an act that probably saved her life
 She ran on all fours, panted with her tongue out, bared her teeth and barked
 Because of her lack of human interaction, she only knew the words ‘yes’ and ‘no’
” Oxana now lives in a clinic in Odessa, working with the hospital’s farm animals

Shamdeo, India, 1972“This is not like Tarzan,” says Fullerton-Batten
 “The children had to fight the animals for their own food – they had to learn to survive
 When I read their stories, I was shocked and horrified
” There are 15 cases in her Feral Children project, staged photographs telling the stories of people isolated from human contact, often from a very young age
 This one shows Shamdeo, a boy who was found in a forest in India in 1972 – he was estimated to be four years old
 “He was playing with wolf cubs
 His skin was very dark, and he had sharpened teeth, long hooked fingernails, matted hair and calluses on his palms, elbows and knees
 He was fond of chicken-hunting, would eat earth and had a craving for blood
 He bonded with dogs
” He never spoke, but learnt some sign language, and died in 1985

Marina Chapman, Colombia, 1959The photographer was inspired to start her project after reading The Girl With No Name, a book about the Colombian woman Marina Chapman
 “Marina was kidnapped in 1954 at five years of age from a remote South American village and left by her kidnappers in the jungle,” says Fullerton-Batten
 “She lived with a family of capuchin monkeys for five years before she was discovered by hunters
 She ate berries, roots and bananas dropped by the monkeys; slept in holes in trees and walked on all fours, like the monkeys
 It was not as though the monkeys were giving her food – she had to learn to survive, she had the ability and common sense – she copied their behaviour and they became used to her, pulling lice out of her hair and treating her like a monkey
” Chapman now lives in Yorkshire, with a husband and two daughters
 “Because it was such an unusual story, a lot of people didn’t believe her – they X-rayed her body and looked at her bones to see if she was really malnourished, and concluded that it could have happened
” Fullerton-Batten contacted her: “She was very happy for me to use her name and do this shoot

John Ssebunya, Uganda, 1991The photographer was advised by Mary-Ann Ochota, a British anthropologist and presenter of the TV series Feral Children
 “She had been to Ukraine, Uganda and Fiji and met three of the surviving children,” says Fullerton-Batten
 “It was helpful in directing me in how they position their hands, how they walk, how they survived – I wanted to make this look as real and as believable as possible
” This image deals with the case of John Ssebunya
 “John ran away from home in 1988 when he was three years old after seeing his father murder his mother,” says Fullerton-Batten
 “He fled into the jungle where he lived with monkeys
 He was captured in 1991, now about six years old, and placed in an orphanage… He had calluses on his knees from walking like a monkey
” John has learned to speak, and was a member of the Pearl of Africa children’s choir
 While many of the stories of feral children are as much myth as reality, Ochota believes Ssebunya’s account
 “This wasn’t part of the standard feral-child hoax yarn,” she wrote in The Independent in 2012
 “We were investigating a real case

Madina, Russia, 2013“These strange, feral children are often a source of shame and secrecy within a family or community,” writes Mary-Ann Ochota on her website
 “These aren't Jungle Book stories, they're often harrowing cases of neglect and abuse
 And it's all too likely because of a tragic combination of addiction, domestic violence and poverty
 These are kids who fell through the cracks, who were forgotten, or ignored, or hidden
” According to Fullerton-Batten, “Madina lived with dogs from birth until she was three years old, sharing their food, playing with them, and sleeping with them when it was cold in winter
 When social workers found her in 2013, she was naked, walking on all fours and growling like a dog
 Madina’s father had left soon after her birth
 Her mother, 23 years old, took to alcohol
 She was frequently too drunk to look after for her child and… would sit at the table to eat while her daughter gnawed bones on the floor with the dogs
” Madina was taken into care and doctors found her to be mentally and physically healthy despite what she had been through

Sujit Kumar, Fiji, 1978“Sujit was eight years old when he was found in the middle of a road clucking and flapping his arms and behaving like a chicken,” says Fullerton-Batten
 “He pecked at his food, crouched on a chair as if roosting, and would make rapid clicking noises with his tongue
 His parents locked him in a chicken coop
 His mother committed suicide and his father was murdered
 His grandfather took responsibility for him but still kept him confined in the chicken coop
” For the children, the transition after being found could be as difficult as the years spent in isolation
 “When they were discovered, it was such a shock – they had learnt animal behaviour, their fingers were claw-like and they couldn’t even hold a spoon
 Suddenly all these humans were trying to get them to sit properly and talk
” Kumar is now cared for by Elizabeth Clayton, who rescued him from an old people’s home and set up a charity housing children in need

Ivan Mishukov, Russia, 1998Despite the harrowing accounts in her series, Fullerton-Batten’s images tell a story of survival
 “All human beings need human contact, but for these children their whole life becomes focused on a survival instinct,” she says, asking “if those living in the companionship of wild animals were perhaps better off than those whose young lives were spent with no companionship at all
” Ivan ran away from his family at the age of four, feeding scraps of food to a pack of wild dogs and eventually becoming a kind of pack leader
 He lived on the streets for two years, before he was taken to a children’s home
 In his book Savage Girls And Wild Boys: A History Of Feral Children, Michael Newton wrote that “The relationship worked perfectly, far better than anything Ivan had known among his fellow humans
 He begged for food, and shared it with his pack
 In return, he slept with them in the long winter nights of deep darkness, when the temperatures plummeted
” Fullerton-Batten believes the ‘feral child’ can reveal much that is hidden within seemingly civilised societies – a city can be as inhospitable as a forest
 “Ivan ran away so it was a choice he made, not to be at home – but his home must have been so bad that he would rather be on the streets with a pack of dogs,” she says
 “I was trying not to be exploitative
 Three of the cases inspired charities – I wanted to raise awareness about what is still going on
” (Credit: Julia Fullerton-Batten)If there is one thing the universe isn’t short of, it’s Alien films
 Ridley Scott first scared the daylights out of us with his acid-blooded, silicon-skinned xenomorph in 1979, and since then there have been three sequels, two Alien v Predator spin-offs, and a prequel, Prometheus, which was also directed by Scott
 Now, he has made another prequel, Alien: Covenant, which brings the number of entries in the franchise up to a Star Wars-rivalling eight
Given that he is now 79, and so he doesn’t have many directing years left, you have to ask whether it’s really the most stimulating use of Scott’s time and talents to churn out yet another inferior copy of a horror masterpiece that debuted nearly four decades ago
 He certainly doesn’t seem to be interested in recapturing the scruffy naturalism, the restraint, or the slow-burning tension which turned the first film into an unforgettable classic
The most salient difference between Alien One and Alien Eight is how clumsy the new film is
Much of Alien: Covenant is simply a humdrum retread of Alien
 Once again, there is a spaceship with a cryogenically frozen crew - a colony ship this time
 Once again the crew members are woken from their hypersleep, once again they pick up a mysterious radio transmission, once again they land on an Earth-like world, and once again they discover some severely rotten eggs
The most salient difference between Alien One and Alien Eight - apart from how formulaic this narrative has become - is how clumsy the new film is
 The space truckers in the original never bothered to tell us anything about themselves
 They never revealed their full names, and they never discussed what they’d left behind on Earth or what was awaiting them elsewhere
 Murmuring, mumbling and whispering their dialogue, they didn’t talk about anything except “the bonus situation”, so we soon came to accept them as ordinary people in an extraordinary situation

The Alien: Covenant screenplay is more conventional
 The crew members - played by Billy Crudup, Katherine Waterson, Danny McBride, among too many others - are handed monologues about their hopes and doubts, detailed arguments about what their next move should be, and sermons about the importance of their mission
 That is, they’re obviously the heroes of a Hollywood blockbuster, rather than a bunch of bored blue-collar employees
 And yet, despite all this speech-making, the characters are less distinctive than their laconic counterparts were in Alien
 They never shut up about their relationships - “wife” must be the most frequently used word in the screenplay - but by the end of the film I still couldn’t remember who was married to whom
Paranoid android
The planet they explore is an inviting, lushly forested wilderness, but otherwise Alien: Covenant has everything you’ve come to expect from an Alien sequel
 Scott and his team ladle out all the usual races down airlocked corridors, they sprinkle on some fan-servicing visual and verbal references to previous instalments, and they serve up a variety of slimy monsters - some tall and lanky, some small and puppy-ish - none of which grips the imagination as tightly as the unstoppable demon which was barely glimpsed in 1979
 You could argue that there was never any good reason to make a sequel (or prequel) to a film which worked by keeping so much hidden and unexplained
 But, for what it’s worth, the recent Alien rip-off, Life, had more thrills and chills
The central portion of the film is so redolent of Blade Runner that you may wonder why Scott didn’t just make a sequel to that
That’s not quite the whole story, though
 At least half of Alien: Covenant is disappointingly familiar: the last 10 or 15 minutes effectively condense the entire first film into one rushed action set-piece
 But there is a section just before that which is strange and haunting enough to justify the enterprise
 I won’t give away what else the characters find on the verdant planet, but this mystical interlude revolves around an android, Walter, played with spine-tingling inscrutability by Michael Fassbender
 An upgraded version of the robot he played in Prometheus, Walter is forced to consider what he owes to the people who manufactured him
 There is a lot of student-y pretentiousness to his musings on Shelley and Wagner, Paradise Lost and Frankenstein, but there is a lot of eeriness, madness and grandeur, too
 More importantly, this is the one part of Alien: Covenant that doesn’t let us predict exactly what’s going to happen next
One question it raises, though, is: what’s all this stuff doing in an Alien film
 It’s clear that Scott is no longer inspired by long-headed, scaly-tailed beasties; the characters who fascinate him are the philosophical replicants who were in his second science-fiction classic, Blade Runner
 Indeed, the central portion of Alien: Covenant is so redolent of Blade Runner in its themes, as well as in its solemn tone and shadowy interiors, that you may wonder why Scott didn’t just make a sequel to that, rather than leaving the job to Denis Villeneuve, whose Blade Runner 2049 is released in October
 If he’d kept his focus on artificially intelligent humanoids, the resulting film might have had the sense of purpose which Alien: Covenant lacks
 Instead, he has engineered a misshapen hybrid: a tired Alien episode with an intriguing Blade Runner episode lodged in the middle
A group of men in tailcoats and women in evening dresses arrives at a grand house
 They are returning from the opera, and their party includes the conductor and one of the singers
 But the servants have fled, sensing something is not right, and the party is affronted when there is no-one in the house’s imposing hall to take their coats
 They retreat upstairs and then – in the first sign that things are about to get really weird – we see the party enter the house again, as if for the first time, and the scene begins again
This moment is from Luis Buñuel’s The Exterminating Angel, a masterpiece of Surrealist cinema from 1962 which has now been thrillingly transformed into an opera itself, with music by British composer Thomas Adès
 The piece was first performed at the Salzburg Festival last year and has just had its UK premiere at the Royal Opera House in London

The great conceit of The Exterminating Angel is that, inexplicably, the guests can’t leave the party
 They dine lavishly and adjourn to the drawing room, where one of the guests, Blanca, entertains them with a piano sonata
 But then at the moment when the evening would usually break up, the rules of polite society begin to break down
 The guests begin to settle down on the sofa and on the floor, and one by one they drift off to sleep
 In the morning when they wake, they find themselves unable to go
 They simply can’t do it; they lack the will
From here the characters are in a downward spiral, from the heights of sophistication and refinement to the depths of depravity
 Disheveled and tortured by hunger and thirst, they fight and bicker, strip off their fine clothes and smash the walls
 By the end of both the opera and the film, several of them will be dead
Angel wings
Buñuel would never give any explanation of his film’s title
 In fact he intended to call it something else, and changed it to The Exterminating Angel only after filming was complete
 In the room where the guests are trapped, there is a panel which opens into a small chamber that, once the social order has collapsed, the guests withdraw into and break the ultimate taboos: it is here where they defecate and have sex, and where a young couple kill themselves
 In the film, the panels of the room are painted with religious scenes and there is an angel on this little door
 “Buñuel comes out of a religious education and background,” says Peter William Evans, professor emeritus of film studies at Queen Mary University London
 He sees the angel as “a secular metaphor, a concept for punishing a society” for its “adherence to a certain kind of bourgeois ideology”
Buñuel sees how bourgeois ideology represses socially, sexually, politically, spiritually – Peter William Evans
Buñuel was taking aim at what Evans calls “the inhibitions, the repressions of bourgeois life”, which he “as a Surrealist, as a free thinker and as a libertine, is keen to expose and to shame
” The Exterminating Angel’s partygoers, for instance, are shown as a vapid bunch, whose conversation is heavy on innuendo, name-dropping and back-stabbing
 But Buñuel himself was not above a bit of bitchy gossip: his autobiography, My Last Breath, is full of waspish asides about the famous people he met
 Picasso, for instance, is “selfish and egocentric” and Jorge Luis Borges is “very pretentious”
 In this sense, could Buñuel himself be guilty of that ultimate bourgeois vice, hypocrisy
 “I met Buñuel in Mexico in 1982, the year before he died, and he had a very bourgeois life,” says Evans
 “He was attracted to the charms of the bourgeoisie
” But at the same time, “he accepts and sees the ways in which bourgeois ideology represses socially, sexually, politically, spiritually
”

Tom Cairns, who wrote the opera’s libretto with Adès and who directs the production at the Royal Opera House says he was “terribly aware of the particular audience that is labeled ‘an opera audience’, and how similar they were to the people on stage
” But, “like all of us,” the characters "are victims of their own class,” he says
 “It could be any group of humans that are subjected to this sort of ordeal
” By the end of the opera, he wants “all of us, of any class, to feel the fear of being alive, of existence and how things can completely crumble in front of you
”

In the opera, the angel is something quite different from Buñuel’s
 It is a distinct presence, almost a character in its own right and perhaps even the star the show
 Adès has represented it with an unusual addition to the orchestra, the ondes martenot, an electronic instrument whose eerie, keening sound – somehow resembling a human voice but at the same time totally otherworldly and strange – has soundtracked a thousand alien landings
 The ondes martenot becomes “the voice of the exterminating angel,” Adès has said, “in the sense that the instrument is heard whenever a figure says something that contributes to the situation of immobility
”
Staying put
Frustration is a key theme in Buñuel’s films, says Evans: “that we are unable to act on our desires for one reason or another”
 Buñuel has this in common with many other artists of the 20th Century, who have memorably explored states of inaction – just think of Beckett’s Waiting for Godot: “Let’s go
 [Stage direction: They do not move]
” Or Jean-Paul Sartre’s Huit Clos (No Exit) in which three characters are locked up in a room, which, despite their attempts to leave, they can’t – and so they remain trapped in the eternal purgatory of each other’s company
 The play contains Sartre’s most famous quote, “L’enfer, c’est les autres” (“Hell is other people”), a sentiment that would be familiar to the guests in The Exterminating Angel and indeed to anyone who has taken a country holiday in bad weather

Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris contains an amusing moment that pokes fun at the exasperation that the characters’ stasis can provoke
 In it, a successful but melancholy screenwriter Gil (played by Owen Wilson) goes back in time to Paris of the 1920s, where he meets many of the avant-garde artists who flocked to the city at that time: Salvador Dalí, Ernest Hemingway, TS Eliot, Gertrude Stein – as well as the young Luis Buñuel
 Late at night, in a café, Gil explains to Dalí, Buñuel and Man Ray that he has travelled from the future, “a perplexing situation” – but as Surrealists, they don’t really see anything strange about it at all
 Later, Gil recounts the plot of The Exterminating Angel to the young Buñuel, 40 years before he will make the film, and this time it is the Surrealist himself who is perplexed: but why don’t they just get up and leave
“We never ever sat down and said ‘what’s this about
’ or ‘what does this mean
’” says Cairns
 “If I’d started to do that I think I’d have just driven up into a cul de sac and got stuck
 It became almost second nature to me that the piece and the ideas behind it were as real as anything else is real
” And sometimes the most straightforward explanations are the best, as in Buñuel’s own account of re-watching his film years later: “I simply see a group of people,” he wrote, “who couldn’t do what they wanted to – leave a room
”Somewhere, waiting to be discovered in an attic, crypt, or fusty loft, is the extraordinary weave of a mythical spider, whose mystifying brocade can only be reconstructed from the antique testimony of those who marvelled at it, centuries ago
 The spider I’m referring to was the visual invention, created in exquisite embroidery, of the Dutch Golden Age artist Katharina Rozee, whose entire body of work has been lost to history in the 335 years since she died in 1682
 In one especially mesmerising piece, Rozee is said to have conjured from silken threads a spider’s delicate needlepoint – “finishing its web among the leaves and branches”, according to one witness, of “the trunk of an old tree covered with moss” – with such lifelike precision, that the artist was accused of dabbling in sorcery

The unveiling this week of a newly-christened species of giant spider, discovered in 2013 by researchers from the San Diego History Museum in an abandoned mine in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur, invites us to reflect upon the exceptional spiders that have loomed large in cultural consciousness and those that crouch in the corners of our imagination
 Officially named Califorctenus cacachilensis, after the Sierra de las Cacachilas mountain range in northwestern Mexico where it was first spotted, the spider’s spindly legs stretch to an unsettling four inches (10cm) in length
 While not as huge as the Giant Huntsman Spider, found in Asia (whose leg-span can exceed 1 foot, or 30cm), Califorctenus cacachilensis is big enough to make the flesh of even the mildest arachnophobe crawl

On reflection, it is intriguing just how much of art history is stitched together by the fearsome filaments of the spider
 Since antiquity, the eight-legged arthropod has stood as an archetypal symbol for weaving and the spinning of fortunes and has crept its way into the iconography of virtually every folkloric tradition, from the Ashanti in North Africa to the Navajo in North America, who attributed the creation of the world to the ‘Spider Grandmother’
 In Greco-Roman mythology, Athena, the goddess of wisdom, craft, and war, spitefully turned a young woman, Arachne, into a spider after being challenged to a weaving contest by the gifted mortal
The Spinners (or ‘Las Hilanderas’) is a painting by the Spanish artist Diego Velázquez, created around the same time that Rozee was needling her stupefying work in the Netherlands
 It depicts Athena and Arachne in mid-spin, trying desperately to out-stitch the other
 Our foreknowledge of the inevitable fate of Arachne, that her lithe and agile limbs will soon be multiplied and transformed into those of a spider, haunts the scene
 Suddenly, the white balls of thread that loll on the floor at Archane’s feet and rest in her hand seem like juddering spider sacs, forever on the verge of exploding with lanky legs
In the modern era of image-making, the spider has lost none of its tensility
 In 1940, the Spanish Surrealist Salvador Dalí reinvented his already iconic dream of time’s fluidity, The Persistence of Memory (1931), by inserting into the heart of his new melting vision, Spider of the Evening, the winnowing pins of a gangly arthropod, whose elongated body anticipates that of the newly announced species discovered in Mexico

In more recent times, the responsibility of conserving the significance of the spider was assumed by the French-American artist Louise Bourgeois, who glimpsed in its disquieting stature the possibility of a universal emblem fused with deep personal meaning
 For Bourgeois, whose drawings, sculptures, and installations were inspired by the spider over a span of 60 years, the creature is a talisman of memory intensified by her affection for her mother (a talented weaver who died when the artist was a student) as well as an indomitable symbol of feminine resilience
Enormous incarnations of Bourgeois’s spiders, such as her famous 30-foot-high (9m) Maman (or ‘Mommy’), have scurried their way into the permanent collections of art institutions across the globe, from Tokyo to London, Doha to Bilbao
 The sheer scale of Bourgeois’s towering bronze legs and dangling sacs of huge marble eggs makes certain that the awesome weave of her imagination will never disappear down the dark shaft of cultural recollection or be lost forever like the forgotten embroideries of Katharina Rozee in an attic, crypt or fusty loft
Imagine you’re living in a dystopian future
 Surveillance cameras scan the streets to recognise and record the faces of passersby – but you’re wearing a HyperFace scarf
 Amid a kinetic assortment of grid-like structures printed on the fabric, black squares suggest tiny eyes, noses and mouths
 The cameras’ facial recognition algorithms are confused
 Your identity is secure; your privacy, protected
Unveiled in January, the HyperFace textile print was designed by the Berlin-based artist Adam Harvey and Hyphen-Labs, an international, all-female design team formed to explore meeting points between technology, art and science
 Harvey has form in anti-surveillance design; a previous project, CV Dazzle, envisaged hair and make-up designs that would foil facial recognition software and heat-reflecting garments that deter drones

When worn, HyperFace gives a computer about 1,200 possible facial options – Harvey was inspired by false colouration in the animal kingdom
 “Instead of imagining camouflage as a means to reduce personal visibility, HyperFace re-thinks the relationship between foreground and background,” Harvey tells BBC Culture
 “The aim is to reduce the confidence score of a true face, by introducing a background comprising false faces
”
Our political climate is making it necessary for us as artists, researchers and creators to explore themes of surveillance – Ashley Baccus-Clark
“Surveillance is a topic that has been top-of-mind at Hyphen-Labs for some time now,” says Hyphen-Labs member Ashley Baccus-Clark, speaking about the project’s inspiration
 “It started with thinking through issues of security, privacy, and visibility as it relates to black women and black communities
 Then, as the events of the past few months have unfolded, our message became more global
”
The election of US president Donald Trump has made liberal-minded creatives, among others, twitchy
 “Our political climate is making it necessary for us as artists, researchers, and creators to explore themes of surveillance,” says Baccus-Clark
Body politics
While celebrities like Kim Kardashian make a career – and arguably an art – of increasing personal visibility, many of us would prefer to stay under the radar
 And while the internet abounds with tips on protecting digital security, designers are coming up with protecting a new battleground: the body
 The inventions are potent mixes of fashion, art and technology that tell us a lot about the world in which we live

Surveillance has been high on the news agenda since mid-2013, when the US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden blew the lid on just how much the NSA could find out about us
 Since then, revelations have come thick and fast: Facebook, Google and Microsoft have handed over customer data under secret NSA programmes; Gemalto, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of Sim cards, has also said it believes its systems were hacked US and UK cyber-surveillance agencies
 Artists have been quick to respond: a new exhibition, Watched
 Surveillance, Art and Photography, which opened recently at the C/O Galerie in Berlin, rounds up some of the contributions international artists are making to the debate about privacy in the wake of the NSA revelations
On a more practical level, Dutch design duo Project KOVR has focused on ways to shield the library of personal information people carry about with them on a day-to-day basis
 From the data in our phones to the tiny computer chips commonly embedded in passport, ID cards and bank cards, the minutiae of our lives exist in Tron-like virtual universes
 Project KOVR’s response is the Anti-Surveillance Coat, a silvery trench cut from metallic fabric that acts like a sartorial Faraday cage, rendering computer chips in bank and ID cards unreadable and mobile phones untraceable
 The designers call their work “a wearable countermovement”, urging us to “stay human in an information-driven environment”
Becoming invisible
The ability to choose when and how to divulge information about ourselves is one of the things that make us human, argues graphic designer Leon Baauw, who co-founded Project KOVR with performance artist Marcha Schagen
 He says their research – which included Yevgeny Zamyatin’s dystopian novel, We, and Jeremy Bentham’s theory of the circular prisons and the related works of philosopher Michel Foucault – “was based upon the question ‘what does it mean for a human being to always be visible’
 How would we change the way we behave
”
Clothing has always protected us against possible threats from the biosphere –  why not the infosphere
 – Leon Baauw
The possibilities of clothing are transforming, says Baauw, from those of decoration, expression and shelter from the elements to ones of maintaining privacy and ultimately, individuality
 “Clothing has always protected us against possible threats from the biosphere; why not the infosphere, that nearly invisible network of connectivity in which we are proven to be vulnerable
” he asks
 “Designers have a great responsibility in designing a better future
 It’s motivating to see more and more projects emerge with the goal of protecting us as well as reminding us that our data and therefore our personality is out there and up for grabs by anyone or anything
”

Facial recognition and digital scanning might currently appear to be the acme of surveillance – but more sinister technologies have been imagined
 In one of their projects, Treviso-based communications research centre Fabrica posits a future in which neuroimaging technology is able to scan minds for suspicious thoughts
 In this Orwellian future they imagine, simply thinking about mutiny could get you into trouble
Designs that shock
Fabrica’s Anti-NIS Accessories are objects that belong to art as much as fashion, addressing that final frontier, privacy of thought
 Each of Fabrica’s pieces provoke a sensory reaction that will attract the wearer’s attention, suddenly changing brain activity
 So if brain scanning were ever to become reality, they would offer a way to keep your thoughts from being read

Prototypes, crafted out of laser-cut felt and wood, include a hat that transmits sound pulses through the skull, a collar that administers a gentle electric shock and a mask that distracts the user with flashing lights
 So if a brain scan were attempted, the wearer’s thoughts are more likely to be read as “blimey, what’s that
” than plans for insurrection
 If the prospect of being randomly zapped at any moment seems unattractive, Fabrica’s work envisages a society where the alternative is more dangerous

The idea of neuroimaging surveillance technology still seems like science fiction but Fabrica’s designs, as well as the work of Harvey and Project KOVR, express genuine concerns among designers about just what the future may look like
 Harvey, for example, is keen to point out that HyperFace is “only an introduction to a larger project about computer vision camouflage”
“When it comes to new technologies, some consumers rightfully feel that most tech companies fail to implement security and privacy measures,” says Mano ten Napel, managing editor of fashion technology website FashNerd
 “This has ignited a need to protect ourselves – which logically translates into the design of the technology we wear
 It’s easy to imagine a future where staying connected will not automatically violate our privacy

Of course, you could make your resistance more obvious
 Shocked by the paparazzi who once drove his friend, supermodel Kate Moss, to cower in a corner at LAX airport in LA, influential fashion photographer Nick Knight designed a black t-shirt that, when hit by camera flash, lit up with a phrase too offensive to repeat here
 The message
 If you can’t beat them, tell them to get lost
In a perfect cinematic universe, every sequel would be like The Godfather Part II, broadening and deepening what came before
 In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, which coasts pleasantly enough on familiarity and a few bright new touches
The film’s spindly plot is just an excuse on which to hang action scenes
Writer-director James Gunn expertly reworks the formula he created for the 2014 original
 Guardians took the Star Wars model and added a comic Earth-born hero, Peter Quill, played endearingly by Chris Pratt with a smart-mouthed edge and love of pop culture
 Pratt and the bouncy 70s and 80s songs on Peter’s old cassette tape made the movie a cheerful, worldwide hit
 (In real life, Peter’s Awesome Mix Vol 1 became a best-selling soundtrack
)
In the sequel, Peter and his ragtag group are now a heroic team for hire
 Zoe Saldana is once again Peter’s green-skinned would-be love, the trained assassin Gamora, but she seems like a bystander this time
 Bradley Cooper is the voice of the streetwise cyber-enhanced raccoon, Rocket, and Dave Bautista is the hulking Drax
 Groot, the animated tree with Vin Diesel’s voice, sacrificed himself in the first film
 He was replanted as a sprout, who becomes one of the best additions to Guardians 2
Baby Groot is a tiny, dancing, mischievous mascot with an expressive tree-trunk face, brought charmingly to CGI life
 He is calculated to be irresistible, and the ploy works
 As a villain says about Baby Groot: “It’s too adorable to kill
”
Like so many other space movies this is essentially a father-son story
The film’s spindly plot is just an excuse, a peg on which to hang action scenes
 When the team is hired to retrieve some valuable battery-sized energy sources, Rocket slips a few in his pocket
 Soon the Guardians are being pursued all over the cartoonish universe
Many antics ensue, but like so many other space movies this is essentially a father-son story
 As the last film ended, Peter learned he was only half-human, on his mother’s side
 The sequel adds a vivid new character, Peter’s long-lost father
 He is played by Kurt Russell with a twinkle in his eye and a swagger that reveals where his son got that roguish attitude
The edible Oedipal
Carrying the baggage of dozens of handsome outlaw roles, Russell starts the film with a rush
 In 1980, he and Peter’s mother zoom along the road while playing the song Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)
 In this flashback, Russell’s face has been restored to youth as magically, or technologically, as Robert Downey’s was when young Tony Stark turned up in Captain America: Civil War
Why has Peter’s father been absent for decades and what is on his mind now
 There is a giant clue in his name, which is not even close to Lovable Dad
 It’s Ego
Ego has one of the movie’s comic high points, analysing the lyrics to Brandy and explaining why it is the best musical composition ever created on Earth
 Guardians could have used more of those moments and fewer chases through space
If Come a Little Bit Closer is playing even a prison break seems sunny
In one plot strand, Peter and Gamora go to Ego’s planet, where there are some lovely, small visual effects
 Father and son toss around a glowing ball of electric blue light as if it were a baseball
But the other storyline follows the pointless rule that sequels must be bigger, as Rocket fends off attack after overblown attack, and engages in endless obligatory shootouts
 Rocket gets more screen time, much of it wasted
 How often can a raccoon be offended at being called a puppy or a rat
The production design can be stunning
 A planet called Sovereign, whose people are gold from head to toe, is ruled by the glamorous, imperious Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki)
 On Sovereign everything is Art Deco-inspired
 Even the space pods sent out to fight the Guardians have a chrome elegance
But visually, there are also weak spots and odd choices
 Gunn often zooms in from cosmic wide shots onto the actors, which makes them resemble lifeless miniatures
  Action scenes fill the screen, as spaceships in crayon colors chase each other against a dark background
 These sequences are busy for the sake of busyness, saved by music from Peter’s Awesome Mixtape Vol  2
 If the energetic song Come a Little Bit Closer is playing even a prison break seems sunny
The film’s major flaw is that Gunn leans so hard on the earnest family theme that he sacrifices too much of Peter’s wise-guy character, a key to the franchise’s charm
 But Guardians deserves more credit than it has received for one underlying message: the characters’ colour-blindness
 Michael Rooker returns as Yondu, Peter’s angry, blue-skinned adoptive father
 Whatever their differences, at least these extraterrestrials are not at odds because of their rainbow-hued faces

 A man who is obviously “indestructible”
 That afternoon the teacher announces that a great man had died in Dallas today
 “The fresh knowledge that followed… was a discovery of history not as what happened in the past but as the current we rode,” Taylor recalls
 The year that John F Kennedy was assassinated is the year in which Taylor, who describes himself as “a repellently good boy like most of my kind, Jewish and going-to-be homosexual”, is “yanked from the random floating mental life of childhood and propelled into youth

 Her Jewish father Benny was serving as a British customs officer in 1939 when he first spotted her mother Khim, a member of the Karen ethnic minority persecuted for centuries by the Bamar majority
 When the Japanese occupied Burma during World War Two, the couple fled to the east to find shelter with Khim’s Karen community
 Barney is imprisoned, and Khim does what she must to survive
 In 1948, after independence, they both support the Karen leaders in what evolves into a decades-long civil war

Patricia Lockwood, Priestdaddy: A MemoirPoet Patricia Lockwood’s father was a Catholic priest, ordained after fitting through an ecclesiastical loophole – he was a married Lutheran minister who converted to Catholicism, thus eligible to apply to Rome for a dispensation, study for the priesthood and be ordained while keeping his wife and children
 He was also “congenitally naughty”, she writes in this probing and often hilarious memoir, which begins when she and her husband Jason, “penniless and exhausted”, spend a year living with her eccentric parents in his Kansas City rectory
 The flow of memory and meditation that follows careens between her girlhood and now, when she’s been dubbed the “smutty metaphor queen” by the New York Times
 And the beginnings of that poetic gift
 Lockwood simply describes it as “that jolt of connection when the language turns itself inside out, when two words suddenly profess they’re related to each other, or wish to be married, or were in league all along

Antonio Di Benedetto, Nest in the Bones (Credit: Credit: Archipelago Books)
Antonio Di Benedetto, Nest in the BonesThis dark, idiosyncratic collection is the first in English by the writer Roberto Bolano called “one of the greatest writers of Latin America”
 Translated from the Spanish by Martina Broner, it includes work from his early days in Argentina, where he was imprisoned and tortured during the ‘Dirty War’, through his exile in Spain
 In the title story, a young boy turns his head into a nest of birds – “blissful sparrows, canaries and partridges” – who are supplanted by “unaccountably voracious” vultures
 “They hurt dreadfully, they hurt down to the bone,” he writes
 In other stories, an imprisoned man dreams that the guard won’t let him rest, a man returned from exile feels like a stranger in his homeland, and Di Benedetto makes a sly reference to Borges, who, along with Pirandello and Dostoevsky, were early influences

 He survives a vicious attack by a group of Tuareg and a yellow fever epidemic to reach his destination, writes back to his command of finding abundant records there, and then disappears from history
 The “manuscripts of Timbuktu,” English notes, were thought to have been destroyed in 2012 by rebels who trashed Timbuktu’s monuments
 English writes vividly of explorations of the past and complications of the present, with a focus on the Indiana Jones-style account of the evacuation of the manuscripts, spearheaded by a courageous librarian named Abdel Kader Haidara

 Ella Nygaard, 27, is a flawed, memorable character
 She has been a ward of the Danish foster care system since she was seven years old
 “My father had blown my mother’s brains out,” she explains
 Troubled by post-traumatic stress disorder, which she tries to fight off with drugs and drink, Ella faces having her own son Alex raised in foster care
 She fights back, taking Alex to the coastal community in northern Denmark where her own family was destroyed by violence
 Under continual scrutiny by neighbours and befriended by strangers who seem eerily familiar, she experiences a series of revelations that grow ever more threatening

 Chris Pratt stars alongside an ensemble cast featuring Kurt Russell, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel; the heroes include a genetically engineered raccoon bounty hunter, a green-skinned love interest and a tree-like humanoid
 The band of space outlaws defend a trove of valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster while exploring issues of parentage; according to The Playlist, writer-director James Gunn “actually has some things to say about family and fatherhood amongst this tale of aliens, space battles and space gods — those who raise you and instill values in you as opposed to your biological parents”
 It’s a sequel that manages to match the success of the first film with “a belly of genuine emotion”

Alien: Covenant (Credit: Credit: Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation)
Alien: CovenantMichael Fassbender and Guy Pearce star alongside Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, James Franco and Noomi Rapace in the sixth episode of the sci-fi horror series – one that looks to be both a sequel to 2012’s Prometheus and a kind of prequel to the 1979 original
 Taking place 10 years after the events of Prometheus, it follows the crew of the Covenant on a mission to colonise a planet when they pick up a distress call
 “In Prometheus, we began the search for who made us and why,” says director and Alien creator Ridley Scott in a featurette, in which Pearce’s character asks: “All these wonders of design and human ingenuity, all utterly meaningless in the face of the only question that matters: where do we come from
” Fassbender – who plays an AI double of the character he played in Prometheus – argues that “this film is like the first Alien, being that it’s very gritty and dark”
 Scott says it will terrify viewers
 “The trick is to have that sense of unease leading to dread… it’s going to be everything you want in an Alien film

SnatchedGoldie Hawn hasn’t been in a film since 2002 – but she agreed to star in this comedy to work with Amy Schumer
 “She’s a funny, smart person who can also make you cry,” Hawn told EW
 “To be matched with someone so deeply instinctive, naturally funny, and incredibly brilliant
 It’s a great coup
” Yet when Schumer first proposed Hawn for the role, film executives said no
 “I said, ‘Over my dead body Goldie is not going to be in this movie
 I’d die for her,’” says Schumer, who co-wrote the film with her sister and Kate Dippold (Ghostbusters)
 Snatched tells the story of a mother and daughter’s South American holiday-turned-kidnapping adventure, and it explores that parent-child relationship as well as offering up laughs
 Director Jonathan Levine says that’s what drew him to the film
 “It’s what I gravitate towards – real character stuff in the midst of funny
” Schumer says it’s been a deeply personal project
 “This is some ways a love letter,” she said
 “You know Trainwreck was kind of to my dad, and this is kind of a peace with my mom

 According to Variety, in the film “a heady, sexy holiday hook-up turns overnight into an abusive abduction – cuing a nightmarish game of sexual control and captivity”; director Cate Shortland “nails a handful of straight-up, nerve-shredding tension sequences”
 The Skinny praises Shortland for “casting promising young women in complex lead roles and drawing out powerful, authentic performances”, while RogerEbert

Manifesto (Credit: Credit: Bayerischer Rundfunk)
ManifestoCate Blanchett has the only speaking part in this adaptation of a multichannel video installation by German artist and film-maker Julian Rosefeldt – and she’s also in nearly every frame
 In the art project, which premiered in Australia in 2015 and toured to Germany and the US in 2016, Blanchett played 13 characters, each reading from different art manifestos
 Viewers of the installation were able to wander about, watching each of the tableaux projected onto screens: this ‘linear version’ instead intercuts the scenes as a patchwork
 While this splicing and dicing does sacrifice “a coherent train of thought”, according to BBC Culture’s Sam Adams, “Manifesto’s visual inventiveness and Blanchett’s multifarious performances make the movie consistently engrossing”
 The star is the main draw
 “Blanchett is expectedly mesmerising, finding different accents and body language to go with the costume changes,” says RogerEbert

 “She’s one of our best actresses, and so viewing Manifesto purely as an acting exercise for her has some inherent value

Harmonium (Credit: Credit: Nagoya Broadcasting Network)
HarmoniumJapanese director Kōji Fukada made this explosive family drama as a companion piece to his award-winning 2010 black comedy Hospitalite – and it’s drawn rave reviews from critics
 When a stranger (Tadanobu Asano) appears at the door of a suburban family home and explains he has just been released from prison after serving 11 years for murder, he is welcomed in by Toshio (Kanji Furutachi), the father, who explains to his wife (Mariko Tsutsui) that the man is an old friend
 What unfolds, says Variety, “makes the viewer question neat causal equations of sin, retribution, and atonement… Cycles of guilt, blame and vindictiveness are replayed in scenes of scorching emotional power, which elicit gut-wrenching performances from Tsutsui and Furutachi”
 It makes for uncomfortable viewing
 According to the South China Morning Post, “Fukada’s film sidesteps easy catharsis to stage a serious, and quite emotionally intense, inquiry into the unknown shades of human nature”

Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (Credit: Credit: Arka Mediaworks)
Baahubali 2: The ConclusionThe 2015 epic Baahubali: The Beginning was the most expensive Indian film ever made, and boasted a list of spectacles to match: “topless men fight bulls, couples kiss amid orchids, hundreds of flogged extras erect a tower”, according to The Guardian
 “At each turn, the money’s right there on screen, yet what’s most striking is how these resources have been marshalled – to enhance, rather than clutter up, the narrative throughline
” Its sequel has surpassed the budget of the first and “is reinterpreting grandeur, scale and vision in Indian cinema”, according to the Indian Express
 The film draws on Indian mythology, starring the actor Prabhas as a superhero-like Shiva, Anushka Shetty as Maharani Devasena, Tamannaah as Avanthika and Rana Daggubati as the villain Bhallaladeva
 Director SS Rajamouli has gained widespread success, despite working outside of Bollywood: shot in Telugu and Tamil as well as Hindi, his Baahubali two-parter has been praised for its universal appeal
 “We believed we could transcend this barrier if we based our stories on basic human emotions without being pulled down by regionalities,” Rajamouli said in an interview

 Following three founders of the Syrian Civil Defense’s White Helmets volunteer rescue organisation as they decide whether to flee with their families or stay and fight for their country, Last Men in Aleppo “brings a rigorous sense of craft and shock-and-awe scale… without impeding its anxious, on-the-hoof spontaneity”
 It makes for difficult viewing – The Guardian described the film as “a 100-minute account of lives lived in hell, without proper medicine and housing” – but, as The Hollywood Reporter argues, “the film demands to be reckoned with as a testament to the selflessness and courage of these literal life savers”

 Their rivalry follows a path that begins with theft but leads to mobsters and murder – as things often do in that part of the world
Although season one was a masterpiece in itself, a terrifically bloody closing act in season two and storyline that relied less on the original film brought an end to any debate about which was better – but it will take an altogether stellar turn from the new cast and a script that truly is stranger than fiction to build on that success

JamestownDon’t let the fact that this is by the makers of cozy costume drama Downton Abbey fool you, as Jamestown is a gritty tale, at times brutal
 Based on true events in the 17th Century, it follows three English women who make the journey across the ocean to marry frontiersmen, leaving their dark pasts behind them
As the first women to arrive in the male-dominated Jamestown, Virginia, they quickly realise they will need all their wit and ambition if they are to survive the inhospitable wilderness and a host of dangerous challenges in the New World

Loaded (Credit: Credit: Channel 4/AMC)
LoadedA long-overdue exploration of the peculiar British distaste for other people’s success, Jon Brown (Veep, Fresh Meat) is writer and executive producer on an eight-part series that follows four tech entrepreneurs and childhood mates who become obscenely rich overnight and whose life-long friendships are put to the test after selling their start-up videogame company
 Could Loaded be the British version of HBO’s Silicon Valley

King Charles III (Credit: Credit: BBC)
King Charles IIIIn the 21st Century, does the British Crown have any real power
 That’s the subject tackled by an adaptation of Mike Bartlett’s award-winning fictional play, set in an imagined future where Prince Charles accedes to the throne after the death of the Queen
 Tim Pigott-Smith OBE, who died last month, reprised his role as Charles from the West End and Broadway productions
After the Queen’s death, Charles finds himself locking horns with Parliament over signing a bill into law, limiting the freedom of the press
 His hesitation results in a crisis that divides his family, with Prince William and Kate Middleton (Peaky Blinders’ Charlotte Riley) realising his actions may threaten their future aspirations and an unhappy Prince Harry who just wants to live with the “common people”

Eurovision Song Contest 2017 (Credit: Credit: BBC/Charlie Clift)
Eurovision Song Contest 2017Eurovision is the world's largest non-sporting live TV event and the most watched live entertainment programme in Europe, having attracted over 200 million television viewers last year
 Whether you love or loathe it, it's undeniable that it's all anyone will be talking about the day after
 This year's event has already drawn controversy, with Russia pulling out of the show after Ukraine barred Russia's contestant Julia Samoilova
Following the artists' parade and the hosts introduction - with Ukraine being the first country to choose three male presenters - the acts will battle it out to take home the iconic glass microphone trophy
 The Grand Final is live on 13 May on BBC One and on national broadcasters

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Credit: Credit: Netflix)
Unbreakable Kimmy SchmidtAfter being held captive underground in a doomsday cult for 15 years by Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne (Jon Hamm), can-do Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) reclaims her life and starts over in New York City
 In the third season, chipper Kimmy is off to do “what most white girls do after high school”, according to kooky landlady Lillian: going to college
The show might be about Kimmy, but gosh dang it, the infectiously catchy songs and her roommate Titus (Tituss Burgess) are the real stars
 Season three might even be worth sticking with to see scene-stealer Titus go “full Lemonade” after having boyfriend troubles

The Keepers (Credit: Credit: Netflix)
The KeepersIf you can’t wait for the follow-up to Making a Murderer, Netflix is releasing a major documentary series which took nearly a year to edit, focusing on the unsolved murder case of a Baltimore nun, Sister Cathy Cesnik, who vanished in November 1969
Lead by director Ryan White (The Case Against 8), the series follows those closely connected to the case and Baltimore citizens determined to uncover the truth
 All seven hour-long episodes will be released simultaneously

Twin Peaks: The Return (Credit: Credit: Showtime/Sky)
Twin Peaks: The ReturnDavid Lynch is back to direct the entirety of this 18-part series – a franchise he once called “as dead as a doornail” – which picks up the mystery where we left off 25 years ago, in the fictional Washington state town that got turned on its head with the shocking murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer
 Little has been revealed of the new series except that scores of the original cast are to reprise their roles, including Kyle MacLachlan as FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, who investigated the murder case among other strange goings-on in the idiosyncratic town
In the final episode of the last season – which arguably gave us the most frightening ending of all time – Laura Palmer tells FBI special agent Dale Cooper: “I’ll see you again in 25 years
” A happy coincidence or fate
 Either way, it seems the time is right to find out what happened to Cooper – and whether the coffee and pie is still worth taking the trip into the mountains

House of Cards (Credit: Credit: Netflix)
House of CardsIf you thought ruthless politician Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) couldn’t get any more sinister, you’ve not heard his character’s chilling monologue on the latest trailer for House of Cards
 “The American people don’t know what’s best for them
 I do
 I know exactly what they need,” he tells his stoic wife Claire (Robin Wright), before proclaiming, “One nation, Underwood
”
If you’ve stuck with the series, you’ll undoubtedly have enjoyed Robin Wright’s character featuring more prominently
 After all, Frank is nothing without Claire, and in season five, things get interesting as the cracks in the relationship really start to show

Castello di Sammezzano, Leccio, ItalyThe mesmerising ceiling, vaults and decor of the Peacock Room in this abandoned Italian palazzo near Florence speak for themselves
 Peacocks, and other exotica, were the source of the inspired decoration to be found throughout the seemingly endless empty rooms of this daydream building
 The Moorish-style makeover of what was a much older palace was the life work of Ferdinando Panciatichi Ximenes d’Aragona
 Although the aristocratic Italian architect, engineer, botanist, philosopher and politician never visited the Levant or the Orient, he imagined a world of exquisite and highly exotic forms and colours that he brought to life in Leccio between 1843 and 1889
 A hotel in the 20th Century, the palazzo and its polychromatic Peacock Room are in limbo today

Ely Cathedral, Cambridgeshire (Credit: Credit: Steve Vidler / Alamy Stock Photo)
Ely Cathedral, CambridgeshireCompleted in 1334 by the royal carpenter William Hurley, the exquisite timber lantern over the central octagonal tower of Ely Cathedral is one of the greatest feats of medieval structural engineering and design
 From the cathedral floor, the lantern appears like the centre of a great, eight-pointed star, with a carving of Christ in Glory at its centre
 Constructed primarily from eight English oak trees, the 30ft-high lantern is supported by highly visible timber fan vaulting and by a hidden tent-like lattice of oak beams
 Wooden panels – decorated with painted angels in the 19th Century – can be opened around the lantern
 Choristers, serving as a heavenly choir, sang through these from the roof of the fenland cathedral

Solna Centrum Metro Station, Stockholm (Credit: Credit: David Bertho / Alamy Stock Photo)
Solna Centrum Metro Station, StockholmBy far the most alluring attraction of Stockholm's Solna Centrum shopping mall is the Blue Line Metro station that has served it since 1975
 Artists Anders Åberg and Karl-Olov Björk painted the exposed bedrock of the underground concourse a thrilling and beautifully lit night-time red
 Riding the escalators here is like being drawn into, or escaping from, some mythical sorcerer's cave
 Since 1957 more artists than it would take to fill the carriage of a Metro train have conjured 94 of the network's 100 stations into memorable public artworks, justifying the widely quoted description of the 70-mile Stockholm Metro as "the world's longest art gallery"
 Perhaps only the Moscow Metro, mostly of an earlier era, rates alongside this remarkable achievement

Grand Central Station, New YorkFor decades the zodiac ceiling of the imposing and much loved concourse of Grand Central was largely invisible
 It was covered in thick layers of nicotine tar, the result of countless cigarettes smoked by generations of commuters making their way to the station's 67 platforms set below the imposing Beaux-Arts style building designed by Warren and Wetmore, and Reed and Stern
 Based on medieval astronomical maps, it was painted by the French artist Paul César Helleu and New York's Charles Basing with a team of assistants
 The signs of the zodiac were outlined in gold leaf on a blue-green backdrop evoking autumn and winter night skies of Greece and Southern Italy
 The cleaned and restored ceiling was unveiled in 1998

Shah Mosque, Isfahan (Credit: Credit: Hossein Lohinejadian / Alamy Stock Photo)
Shah Mosque, IsfahanIn 1598, Shah Abbas moved the Persian capital to Isfahan
 Here, he commissioned a remarkable sequence of ambitious and beautiful religious and civic buildings
 But, because the only readily available building material in Isfahan was baked mud brick, there was a fear that, however grand, the new buildings would look rather dull
 New techniques in firing coloured mosaic tiles, however, allowed the Shah's architects to revel in wondrous displays of decoration, brought to perfection here in the Shah Mosque (1612-38)
 Designed by the master calligrapher and miniaturist Rezza Abbasi, the blue, yellow, turquoise, pink and green tiles catch and reflect the light of this bright and hot city, animating cool spaces under the great blue dome of Abbas's mosque

Haesley Nine Bridges Golf Club House, Yeoju-gun, South Korea 
Haesley Nine Bridges Golf Club House, Yeoju-gun, South KoreaDesigned by Shigeru Ban, the Japanese architect famous for a new generation of paper and cardboard buildings, this country club opened in 2010 features a notably elegant atrium lobby
 A laminated timber grid shell supported seamlessly by lightweight, three-storey-high columns of the same material forms its ceiling and roof
 Computer cut, columns and grid shell employ as little material as possible
 The filigree, fireproof columns allow the free flow of air through the atrium, their design inspired by ‘bamboo wives’ [zhúfūrén], traditional lattice-framed bamboo bolsters
 In hot and humid weather, these are cooler to sleep on than sheets and pillows
 The lightweight form of the ceiling grid shell is reflected in a pool creating an intentionally poetic effect

Heydar Aliyev Centre, Baku, AzerbaijanThe floor, walls and ceilings of the curvaceous auditorium of this bravura cultural centre, opened in 2012, form a seamless whole
 The effect is magical and truly remarkable, as if the architect, Zaha Hadid has dissolved the normal rules of construction and reinvented their own
 In fact, the geometrically complex laminated white-oak shell of the auditorium is set within a steel frame
 This gives the necessary rigidity to the structure while allowing and the auditorium to feel as if it is floating in free space
 Zaha Hadid had long wanted to shape such a fluid architecture
 With the latest computer wizardry, she has achieved this in Baku
 You will never look at a ceiling in quite the same way again

San Pantalon, Dorsoduro, Venice (Credit: Credit:  Sylvain Sonnet/Corbis)
San Pantalon, Dorsoduro, VeniceFor a few awe-inspiring moments, a 50-cent euro coin lights up the ceiling of this unfinished Baroque parish church
 A dazzling late 17th Century oil painting covering 443 sq m (4768 sq ft) gives the illusion of continuing the architecture of the church up through chiaroscuro colonnades and a choir of highly animated winged angels through golden skies to the white light of heaven itself
 This illusionistic painting, with its thrillingly foreshortened perspectives, is the work of Gian Antonio Fumiani (1645-1710)
 The influential 19th Century English critic, John Ruskin, described The Martyrdom and Apotheosis of St Pantalon as "the most curious example in Europe of the vulgar dramatic effects of painting
" He was quite wrong: dig in your pocket for another 50 cents

Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, Temple of Heaven, Beijing (Credit: Credit: John Slater/CORBIS)
Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, Temple of Heaven, BeijingTemple of Heaven is a vast complex of religious buildings built during the reign of the Ming Dynasty Yongle emperor (born Zhu Di)
 Completed in 1420, the three-tiered Hall of Prayer evoked and represented the hours, days, months and seasons of the years in an architecture of precise geometry and gloriously colourful timber components culminating in an imperious dome
 The 125ft (38m) high temple was constructed without a single nail, the timber columns and rafters slotting together like a giant building kit
 The distinctive colours represent various evocations of good fortune, joy, prosperity and the glory of imperial rule
 Burned down in 1889 and rebuilt, the temple interior was repainted to look brand new for the 2008 Beijing Olympics

St Stephen Walbrook, City of London (Credit: Credit: Graham Prentice / Alamy Stock Photo)
St Stephen Walbrook, City of LondonViewed from the confine of City lanes, St Stephen Walbrook appears to be a very modest structure
 Inside, however, this church designed by Christopher Wren proves to be one of the architectural wonders of late 17th Century Europe
 Carried on eight Corinthian columns and eight arches punctuated by clear windows, is a magnificent coffered dome
 This is a scale-model of the dome Christopher Wren had hoped to build over his original design for St Paul's Cathedral
 The Church Commissioners turned this down, and yet we can see what Wren had intended inside this quiet church 
 Although capacious, the 63ft (19
3m) dome - made of timber, plaster and copper - is, unlike that of St Paul's, light, resting gently on St Stephen's

How often have we all heard that resigned expression
 How often have we said it ourselves
 ‘The death of cinema’ is debated in university film studies programs worldwide
 Critics lament the loss of 'small movies' in favour of superhero spectacles
 Box-office analysts look for signs of an industry on the brink
 Studio executives fear that video-on-demand may destroy the idea of going to the cinema more than broadcast and cable TV ever did
And what can we really call a new classic
 What in recent vintage can hold its own on the big screen with the likes of The Searchers, The Godfather, The Rules of the Game, Seven Samurai or Citizen Kane
 Some film journalists even think the movie star is a thing of the past
Perhaps the fault lies not in our movie stars, but in ourselves
 If you can’t find masterpieces amid the blockbuster flotsam, you simply aren’t looking hard enough
 Film-making today, whether massively expensive or made with tiny budgets, shot on celluloid or video, is thriving artistically as much as it ever has
 But today you’ll find greater diversity in the kinds of films being made, if not in the people who are making them
 That’s why we, the editors of BBC Culture, decided to commission a poll of critics to determine the 100 greatest films of the 21st Century
 Last year, we asked critics to name the greatest American films of all time, and we were surprised that only six films made since 2000 made the top 100
 Is there a feeling that time sanctifies a classic
 Perhaps
 But this time, we wanted to prove that this century has given us films that will stand the test of time, that you will continue to think about and argue about if only you give them a chance and watch them
For our poll to determine the 100 greatest American films, we surveyed 62 film critics from around the world
 This time, we received responses from 177 – from every continent except Antarctica
 Some are newspaper or magazine reviewers, others write primarily for websites; academics and cinema curators are well-represented too
 For the purposes of this poll we have decided that a list of the greatest films of the 21st Century should include the year 2000, even though we recognise that there was no ‘Year Zero’ and that 2001 is mathematically the start of the century
 Not only did we all celebrate the turn of the millennium on 31 December 1999, but the year 2000 was a landmark in global cinema, and, in particular, saw the emergence of new classics from Asia like nothing we had ever seen before
We believe that the new classics on this list are destined to become old classics
 Whether or not that happens is ultimately up to you, the moviegoers
 But one thing is certain: cinema isn’t dying, it’s evolving

 Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, 2001)In March 1974, Yang Zhifa, a farmer, along with his five brothers and their neighbour Wang Puzhi, were digging a well in pomegranate and persimmon fields an hour’s bus ride northeast of Xi’an, capital of China’s Shaanxi province
 Their shovels hit a terracotta head they mistook for an image of the Buddha
 Within months, teams of archaeologists and officials arrived on the scene
Red Guards had exhumed the body of another emperor, publicly denounced it and burned it
What the farmers had stumbled upon proved to be one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of the 20th Century
 Buried below the fields were thousands of life-sized and deftly sculpted terracotta warriors dating from the 3rd Century BCE reign of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a united China
(Credit: Wikipedia)
Qin Shi Huang, who died aged 49 in 210 BC, was the first emperor to unite the warring states of China into a single nation (Credit: Wikipedia)
Perhaps it was lucky that this subterranean army had been discovered at the tail end of Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution
 In 1969, zealous Red Guards had made a manically destructive raid on the underground tomb of the Ming emperor Wanli (1563-1620) outside Beijng
 The skeletons of the emperor and two of his empresses were dragged to the door of the tomb, publicly denounced and burned
 This was some years before the People’s Republic began investing in tourism and new museums, some 4,000 of them since the red star set on the Cultural Revolution in 1976

Qin Shi Huang was obsessed with attaining immortality and sent Xu Fu on an sea voyage to find the elixir of life – Xu never returned (Credit: Alamy)
The uncovering of legions of life-like terracotta warriors excited China and thrilled the world
 Qin Shi Huang’s soldiers marched into the British Museum in September 2007
 Over the next six months more than 850,000 visitors came to inspect them
 Only 1972’s Treasures of Tutankhamun show drew a bigger crowd
 Some of the warriors are now going on show among 160 other works of art drawn from 32 Chinese museums and archaeological institutions in the exhibition Age of Empires: Chinese Art of the Qin and Han Dynasties at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, and a veritable army of visitors is expected
The warriors are indeed special
 Buried in formation in brick-lined trenches, each appears to have its own character, although in fact their moustachioed faces are derived from 10 basic types
 Originally painted in bright red, blue, pink and gold, today Qin Shi Huang’s kit-of-parts warriors are bleached of colour
 Time and the ravages of nature have also robbed the warriors of the real weapons they once bore
Ye who enter
Intriguingly, the sheer number of warriors and their armoury suggest they were made through an early form of mass production
 And, yet, should we have expected anything less from Qin Shi Huang, the dynamic young king who united China in 221 BCE and forged his vast empire together through the imposition of single systems of writing, money, weights and measures along with die-straight canals and roads
 To protect his northern border, the emperor began construction of the Great Wall of China
Qin Shi Huang drank mercury, thinking it would give him eternal life
Hugely ambitious, Qin Shi Huang sought eternal life
 He dispatched a minister overseas, never to return, in search of a magic potion
 Knowing of ancient kings and sages who had lived 10,000 years and more by ingesting cinnabar (mercury sulfide), the emperor took to drinking draughts of wine sweetened with honey and laced with mercury
(Credit: Alamy)
Qin was interred in a massive mausoleum, still unopened to this day, that was surrounded by the terracotta army (Credit: Alamy)
By the time he died at the age of 49, presumably through mercury poisoning, Qin Shi Huang had all but completed his colossal underground tomb
 If he were unable to rule forever in waking life, then he would be emperor until the end of time in the afterlife

More than 1
5m people visit the terracotta warriors excavation site in Xi’an annually – and they have drawn huge crowds at museums around the world (Credit: Alamy)
The scale of the Chinese emperor’s mausoleum, the size of a great ancient city, remains breathtaking, its core a pyramid that once rose to 100m (328ft)
 Less than half this height today and long greened by vegetation the pyramid remains clearly visible
 In terms of Chinese tradition, it forms the eye of a propitious landscape that can be read as a dragon
Tomb raiders
As for the 8,000 terracotta warriors, these – standing in line beyond the tomb itself – are there to guard the secrets of Qin Shi Huang’s underground empire
 And secrets there are, and will be for many years to come, as the tomb remains sealed
A river of mercury and crossbows rigged to fire are said to guard the tomb
Archaeologists and museologists worldwide agree that opening the tomb would be a disaster, as exposure to air would damage it irreparably
 In early digs to uncover the terracotta warriors, the lacquer beneath their painted faces and uniforms curled after just 15 seconds
 More than this, though, according to 2nd Century BCE historian Sima Qian – whose description of the mausoleum has proven to be far more accurate than modern historians had once thought – rivers of mercury surround the emperor’s burial chamber
 If they do, this would be a treacherous place to enter
 Recent scientific studies have shown that soil here contains unusually high concentrations of mercury, although whether or not the emperor’s advisors could have produced so much liquid metal remains a matter of conjecture
(Credit: Alamy)
Terracotta horses, carts and chariots were also carved and buried to guard the emperor’s tomb (Credit: Alamy)
If no one is willing to enter, or even to probe the tomb for fear of causing damage to the treasures that surely lie within, there are further reasons for keeping well away
 According to Sima Qian, mechanical crossbows guard entrances and passageways
 Do they exist
 Have they rotted away, or – chromium-plated – might they still send deadly bolts hissing through the darkness towards the flesh-and-blood torsos of would-be Indiana Joneses

Until new techniques are discovered, the secrets of Qin Shi Huang’s tomb will remain a haunting mystery
 In the meantime, the army of terracotta warriors found beyond it are enveloped in supposition, too
 As further pits were revealed during the 1970s, mounted warriors and chariots driven by life-like horses were uncovered along with simulacra of generals and high-ranking officials
 The top-knotted infantrymen known to so many museum visitors – in their own special way, the terracotta warriors have conquered the world – have been joined since by standing and kneeling archers, spear-wielding charioteers, strongmen, acrobats, dancers, musicians and exquisite bronze sculptures of swans, ducks and cranes
Samples of DNA taken from a number of skeletons suggest that some of the emperor’s enormous workforce were of European origin
 Had Ancient Greeks shown the Chinese how to sculpt figures and horses as magnificently as Phidias and his studio had when they carved the frieze of the Parthenon in 5th Century BCE Athens
 Certainly nothing like the terracotta warriors or their cavalry’s horses had been seen in China before the building of Qin Shi Huang’s mausoleum

We can only wait to find out more about this astonishing place, its secrets first uncovered by Yang Zhifa, his brothers and Wang Puzhi 43 years ago
 Unlike the terracotta warriors this gang of seven has struggled to survive – the farmers made little or nothing from their discovery
 In the interest of tourism, their land was taken away
 In 1997, poverty stricken and sick, Wang Puzhi hung himself
 Within three years, Yang Wenhai and Yang Yanxin, jobless and unable to afford doctors, died in their early 50s
In 2007, Liu Xiquin, wife of Yang Quanyi, whose family home had been demolished, told the South China Morning Post, that her husband was afraid that he and his brothers “might have brought misfortune in some way, and does still wonder if maybe the soldiers should have been left beneath the ground
”Impressionism changed everything
 Born of defiance and a rejection of tired traditions, the collective visions of Monet and Manet, Morisot and Renoir, Pissarro and Sisley became (and remain to this day) more popular than any in the history of image-making
 If that weren’t remarkable enough, the movement’s nerve and verve succeeded in opening the floodgates to a dizzying proliferation of artistic ideas, ideals and painterly techniques that altered forever the story of art
The last 150 years have had four times as many art movements as in the previous millennium
Before Impressionism’s emergence in the 1860s, prevailing artistic tastes shifted relatively slowly
 One could be forgiven for thinking, over-simplistically, that one dominant school followed another with a kind of fluid inevitability, like the passing of an aesthetic baton from one era to next: the Renaissance handing off to Mannerism, Baroque to Rococo, Romanticism to Realism
 But when Impressionism entered the race, suddenly that single lane of traffic divided into many, as separate strands spidered away from the linear path into a spaghetti of creative confusion
 The ensuing century and a half witnessed more than four times as many distinct and nameable movements than the entire millennium that came before
This year alone marks the centenary of the formal establishment of at least three separate artistic schools that emerged independently in three different locations: De Stijl in the Netherlands, Productivism in Russia and Pittura Metafisica in Italy
 The first of these, De Stijl, remains familiar to more than merely devoted students of art history
 The geometric colour blocks of Piet Mondrian, one of De Stijl’s co-founders, continue to mesmerise
 But how many of us can, without the aid of Google, picture in our mind’s eye a work by De Stijl’s Russian and Italian creative siblings – hugely significant interludes in Modern art, but hardly household terms
For every Expressionist, Cubist, Surrealist and Pop Art legend that our eyes know by heart, there’s a Tonalist, Vorticist, Biomorphist and Maximalist whose imagination rings a bell but whose manifesto slips the mind
 What follows is a crib sheet to seven art movements that came and went since Impressionism upset the artistic apple cart – movements you know you know, but can’t quite name
Synthetism (circa 1877 - 1893)
The Flageolet Player on the Cliff by Paul Gauguin, 1889 (Credit: Wikipedia)
As their name suggests, Synthetists were interested in unity
 Unsatisfied with Impressionism’s sleight of hand, they strove to balance both an object’s appearance and the emotion it provokes, rather than privileging one or the other
 The Flageolet Player on the Cliff(1889), a painting by the French artist Paul Gauguin, is emblematic of the style
 Glimpsed from a precarious vantage, a girl swings her scythe in time to the romantic notes wafting from the flute of a boy beside her on the ledge-like path
 Gauguin manages to capture the vertigo of young love while at the same time remaining faithful to every humid gradation of the day’s dying light
Tonalism (1880s and ‘90s)
Moonrise by George Inness, 1887 (Credit: Wikipedia)
At the same moment that the Synthetists were striking an equilibrium between feeling and form, a group of artists in the US were earning the nickname Tonalists for their tendency to draw a gauzy veil of light-suspending atmosphere across their works
 James McNeill Whistler was one of the school’s attendees and so was the spiritually-sensitive George Inness – a devotee of the mystical writings of the Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg
 Only a whisper of lunar light illuminates the marshes of Alexandria Bay, New York, in Inness’s 1887 canvas, Moonrise
 Swaddled in quarter-light, the sodden landscape through which a barely-visible boatman appears to pass from one state of existence to another dissolves into a murky mist before our very eyes
Purism (1918 - 1925)
Still Life With Glass of Red Wine by Amédée Ozenfant, 1921 (Credit: Wikipedia)
Almost as quickly as the Cubist pioneers Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque had established the movement’s epoch-defining principles of fragmentation and multi-perspectivism in the 1910s, there was kickback
 Among those putting the boot in were the French painter and writer Amédée Ozenfant and the celebrated French-Swiss architect Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (known as Le Corbusier)
 Wishing to restore geometric soundness to objects (and objecting to how fashionable, decoratively, Cubism had become), Ozenfant and Le Corbusier argued for a robust simplicity of forms
 Ozenfant’s Still Life with Glass of Red Wine (1921) is a case in point
 Where Cubists would merrily smash to smithereens the simplest bottle of red, the Purists saw the world as archetypally intact and brought to the table something reliably solid instead
Precisionism (1920s and 30s)
I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold by Charles Demuth, 1928 (Credit: Wikipedia)
Some art schools take things in fresh new directions
 Others innovate by unifying
 They strive to consolidate the salient ideas of forerunning schools
 Precisionism is one of those
 Hailed as the first native art movement to plant roots in the United States, Precisionism absorbed principles of rivalrous European manifestos in its evocation of uniquely American themes
 Charles Demuth’s iconic I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold (1928) is indicative of the eclectic style
 Inspired by William Carlos Williams’s 1921 imagistic poem The Great Figure, Demuth captures the deafening reverberations of a fire engine’s blaring approach in a fierce fracture of colour and sound that is neither Cubist nor Futurist, yet both
Rayonism (1910s)
Red Rayonism by Mikhail Larionov, 1913 (Credit: Wikipedia)
With obsessive attention to the behaviour of light on objects, the Impressionists startled and delighted
 Decades later, in the 1910s, a pair of Russian artists, Mikhail Larionov and Natalia Goncharova, took things to another level by removing material substance altogether while retaining the sharp shards of light that it reflects
 The result was Rayonism: shattered meshes of refracted colour such as Larionov’s Red Rayonism (1913)
 Though convinced their school represented the culmination of all previous artistic movements, Rayonism proved in fact to be merely another nudge toward that impending seismic surge that will strike in the 1940s, Abstract Expressionism, whose epicentre would not be Russia, but the United States
Synchromism (1910s and 20s)
Cosmic Synchromy by Morgan Russell, 1913-14 (Credit: Wikipedia)
While the Russian Rayonists were busy stripping form from light, a duo of American artists, Stanton MacDonald-Wright and Morgan Russell, were endeavouring to distill a rhythmic eye-music from the silent syncopations of pure colour
 They called their project Synchromism and the individual works that comprised it, ‘synchromies’
 Russell’s Cosmic Synchromy, painted between 1913 and 1914, is characteristic of the movement’s ambition to record in colour luminous symphonies of seeing: the mute music of the mesmerising spheres
Lettrism (1942 - )
Hypergraphie, Polylogue by Isidore Isou (Credit: Isidore Isou, 1964)
Where Synchromism coaxed from quiet colour an orchestra of harmonious hues, a later movement, known as Lettrism, sought to sync the competing urgencies of language and image into a merged melody
 Conceived in the 1940s by Isidore Isou, a Romanian expat to creatively-feverish Paris, Lettrism (or “Letterism” as Isou preferred) waged its campaign to change the way we experience art on a variety of cultural fronts: from literature to cinema, graphics to politics
 Painters enlisted in the Lettrist cause forged a fresh genre of image-making they called ‘hypergraphics’ – a hybrid verbal-visual vision that relied for its effect on an erosion of the boundaries between reading and looking
 In Isou’s own painting Hypergraphie, Polylogue, from 1964, an abacus of strange, hieroglyphic-like symbols is slowly blotted out by a huge indecipherable cipher as literal language and the splotches of abstraction slip into a seamless primordial soup of something seen
 Through the Lettrist’s integrating eyes, art is the last word
“Cheese,” as the US intellectual Clifton Fadiman put it, is “milk’s leap toward immortality
” And what milk began, generations of artists have been keen to develop
 The humble food stuff has been muse to some of the greatest artists from the Dutch Golden Age to the 21st Century
There is no denying the fact that it is the star of the Mauritshuis’s new exhibition, Slow Food : Still-Lifes of the Golden Age
 The canvases overflow with sumptuous edibles and tableware, from lobster and candied fruits to delicate façon de Venise glasses and elegant golden tazze, but it is the cheeses that draw the eye
Peeters pretzels

Depicted in exquisitely detailed stacks or arranged enticingly in straw baskets, they demand to be savoured, as Quentin Buvelot, the Mauritshuis’s infectiously enthusiastic curator is well aware
  “That is why we called the exhibition Slow Food
 With a meal you have to take your time to consume it and we say take your time to consume the paintings
”
And consume is certainly what the viewer yearns to do when confronted with Pieter Claesz’s basket of cheeses, a dish of butter curls balancing precariously on top of them
 One can sense the delight this masterly painter took in depicting the crevices left by a knife as it cut through the truckle, leaving a trembling flake which demands to be plucked off and eaten by hungry fingers
Watch the video above to learn how cheese became art's greatest muse
Physicians recommended its consumption at the end of a meal to ‘close the stomach’
Perhaps unsurprisingly some tried to see a warning against gluttony in the sensual depiction of texture, but Julie Hochstrasser, an expert in Dutch art and trade, firmly believes this is not the case
 “The depictions are so luscious and enticing that I couldn’t believe it was simply a warning of what not to do,” she tells BBC Culture
 Having uncovered contemporary physician’s manuals, which extolled the digestive properties of cheese and recommended its consumption at the end of a meal in order to ‘close the stomach,’ she found that in many detailed respects the paintings were simply following their recommendations
Claesz still life with cheese and fruit

The fact that the export of cheese played such an important role in the Dutch economy opened the way to an alternative interpretation
 “Not as a warning against, but as a declaration of pride in the prosperity of this newly founded country
”
This is most certainly evident in the stack of cheeses by Floris van Dijck
 Dominating the canvas, they are rendered with the gravitas of rock, their economic value emphasised by the fact that they are placed on a table covered in red damask, an exceptionally expensive product at the time
  “Just seeing it you know you’re in a rich household,” says Buvelot

The highlight of the exhibition is undoubtedly Clara Peeters’ Still life with Cheeses, Almonds and Pretzels
  The large halved Gouda at the rear is portrayed in such astonishingly fine detail that one cannot help but desire to taste it, as indeed someone already has: the plugged hole left by a cheese taster’s scoop is clearly visible
  In front sits a greenish cheese, probably from Edam, its peculiar hue attained from the horseradish or parsley juice added to the milk
 The knife pointing out towards us offers enticement to try this extinct delicacy
 It’s a format that must have pleased buyers as she painted four other very similar versions
 Buvelot himself has a copy of it in his office
 Does it make him hungry
 “It makes me happy,” he laughs
Grate expectations
A century after the paintings featured in the exhibition, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, possibly France’s finest still-life painter, was portraying cheese in his own uniquely refined manner
 He does not let them dominate the canvas in the manner of his Dutch predecessors but his exquisite feeling for colour, texture and tone cannot help but draw the viewer’s gaze
 As Kenneth Bendiner, author of Food in Painting, puts it, “what makes Chardin different is his simplicity
” The emphasis is on the formal beauty of these objects and in this he excels

 Dainty cups and elegant wine glasses suggest it will be part of a simple yet refined afternoon tea, in tune with the culinary dictates of the day
 In Still Life with Copper Pot, Cheese and Eggs he takes obvious delight in the texture of a small round cheese, a good third cut away to reveal its luscious golden interior
Lichtenstein’s Cheese Head is reportedly a critique of Ronald Reagan
In the 19th Century Raphaele Peale, the first still-life painter in the US, savoured the yellow tones of a half-devoured snack in Cheese with Three Crackers
 Antoine Vollon, hailed as a second Chardin, revelled in the beauty of a Brie laid out on a simple straw mat
 No-one could infer a symbolic meaning in his work
 It is a pure celebration of texture, form and tone
Dali

Until this point the portrayal of food, including cheese, was very much about enjoyment but in the 20th Century artists began to take a rather more experimental tone
 René Magritte riffed on possibly his most famous work, Ceci n’est pas une pipe, by placing a framed painting of a Brie under a glass dome and declaring emphatically Ceci est un morceau de fromage (‘This is a piece of cheese’)
  A few years later Salvador Dalí was inspired by a particularly unctuous Camembert to create the clocks in The Persistence of Memory, one of the most recognised images in art history
 Some saw the influence of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity in the work but Dalí insisted they were nothing but “the tender, extravagant and solitary paranoiac-critical Camembert of time and space
”  
Twiggy

Roy Lichtenstein adopted Swiss cheese as a recurring motif, most notably in Cheese Head, reportedly a critique of Ronald Reagan’s comment that the poor should be given surplus cheese, and at the tail end of the century, the sculptor Cosimo Cavallaro draped Twiggy in cheese as a comment on the ephemeral nature of fashion
 Somewhat more poignantly the video and installation artist Mona Hatoum used a giant cheese grater to reflect on her experiences of exile at the time of Lebanon’s civil war
Big cheese
Cheese as an object of beauty in itself has recently been rediscovered by Christian Furr, famous for being the youngest artist ever to paint the Queen
 The two subjects couldn’t be more different but he sees them as equally valid
Furr Epoisses

Primarily drawn to their visual qualities he tells BBC Culture there is also an, “element of craft that I like to celebrate
” He has painted everything from a solid Beemster to a gently oozing Petit Langres against plain backgrounds carefully chosen to compliment the rich range of textures and tones of the cheeses
 Intriguingly he has also found inspiration in mass produced cheeses such as Dairylea
 “They have this humour about them that I really like,” he explains
  In these, other meanings can inadvertently creep in
 He recalls placing a Babybel decorated with a Union Jack in the middle of his studio
 “It was just after Brexit and it looked quite lonely
”
Furr Laughing Cow 
Furr also finds inspiration in mass-produced cheeses such as Babybel, Laughing Cow and Dairylea (Credit: Christian Furr/Bridgeman Images)
He has said that he wants his cheese paintings to express the full range of human emotions and also believes that you can tell a lot about someone from their taste in cheese
 Sarah Lucas’s is apparently Cheddar
 “And when you look at her work, it’s in keeping
” Furr’s own favourite cheese is mature Gouda which, as an heir to the Dutch masters, seems quite apt
The shape of the world is hanging by a thread – or rather, according to experts, by a 110 mile-long (177km) rift
 That’s the extent of a rapidly expanding crack in an enormous ice shelf in Antarctica
 When the Larsen C shelf finally splits, the largest iceberg ever recorded (bigger than the US state of Rhode Island and a third the size of Wales) will snap off into the ocean
 Widening each day by 3 ft (1 m), the groaning cleft is on the verge of dramatically redrawing the southern-most cartography of our planet and is likely to lead, climatologists predict, to an acceleration in the rise of sea levels globally

An aerial photo of the frigid fissure, taken late last year when it was discovered that the pace of the icy tear was quickening, was suddenly back in the news this week with the announcement that a second rift in the shelf had been detected
 The fracture leads our eye along a zig-zagging path – from the backward gaze of the plane’s right engines to the pristine polar blue of the horizon in the distance
 The jaggedness of the cleft, which takes our vision on a journey whose ultimate destination is unfathomable, seems at once monumental and terrifyingly fragile
 The photo intensifies our helplessness in the face of cataclysmic change
 It freezes the potential destruction in the blink of a camera’s shutter, while at the same time hinting at a catastrophe that we can witness unfolding but are utterly powerless to stop

As a visual statement, the aerial photo of the Larsen C crack is, by definition, incomparable; never before has the world marked the glacial advance of such a sublime and fearsome fracture in its very fabric
 Yet the reemergence of the image in the news anticipates the ten-year anniversary of one of the most intriguing and innovative large-scale works in contemporary art – a work whose power relies for its thought-provoking effect on the peculiar poetry of ruinous rifts
 In October 2007, the Colombian-born artist Doris Salcedo unveiled in London an ambitious installation in the cavernous space of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall – a piece that split reaction down the middle
Inviting gallery-goers into the otherwise empty and austere interior of the former Bankside Power Station, Salcedo subverted expectations
 Rather than offering visitors a hall of temporarily installed sculptures, she orchestrated the contemplation instead of a ragged subterranean breach that appeared to rip open the concrete floor of the structure – a crevice that extended from one end of the yawning space to the other

Salcedo deepened the mystery of her bold and experimental conceptual work by giving to it the curious title Shibboleth – a biblical word which, when mispronounced, was said to have exposed the outsider status of individuals
 Complicating matters still further, the artist insisted that her work was a comment not on the folly of material ambitions, but on racism – that deep cultural scar that tears at the foundations of humanity
 Placed side-by-side, this week’s photo from Antarctica and the image captured a decade ago of Doris Salcedo’s challenging Shibboleth share both a brutal beauty and a common theme: the brittleness of being
Once upon a time a small orphan was packed off to live with his aunts
 They were a sadistic pair, these sisters, and rather than console and nurture they abused and enslaved him, bullying, beating and half-starving him
 But he got his revenge, literally crushing them as he finally escaped, bound for adventure and a better life
 It doesn’t sound much like the set-up of a bestselling children’s book, but what if I told you that the boy’s getaway vehicle was a gargantuan fuzzy-skinned fruit
James

James and the Giant Peach sprang from bedtime stories Roald Dahl told his daughters
 He’d already seen modest success with his short stories for adults, twisted tales with grisly punch lines, which were published in magazines such as the New Yorker and Playboy
 This was his first work for children but it left plenty of adult readers deeply disturbed
 Though the book appeared in the US in 1961, Dahl had to wait until 1967 before a British publisher would risk it, and even then, he had to agree to stump up half the costs himself – a savvy-seeming move when the book later became a bestseller

James and the Giant Peach has been lambasted for its racism, profanity and sexual innuendo
He followed it with more than 15 other books for children, stories bursting with gluttony and flatulence, in which wives feed their husbands worms and the young are eaten by giants and changed into mice by bald, toeless hags
 Villains loom large; as mean as they are ignorant, they tower over pint-sized protagonists, twirling them around by their pigtails or banishing them to places like ‘the Chokey’, Miss Trunchbull’s nail-studded punishment cupboard
Fox 
Titles such as Fantastic Mr Fox, The BFG and Matilda regularly appear on lists of the most popular children’s books ever (Credit: Illustrations © Quentin Blake)
Today, titles like Fantastic Mr Fox, The BFG and Matilda, which was released just two years before his death, aged 74, in 1990, regularly appear on lists of the most popular kids’ books ever
 All told, his work has sold more than 200 million copies worldwide
 The controversy has never gone away though
 In the decades since its publication, James and the Giant Peach has been lambasted for its racism (remember that bit where the Grasshopper declares “I’d rather be fried alive and eaten by a Mexican”
), profanity (‘ass’ appears at least three times), references to drugs and drink (all that snuff and whiskey), and sexual innuendo (a scene in which a spider licks her lips got readers in Wisconsin hot under the collar), not to mention its alleged promotion of disobedience and – wait for it – communism
Chocolate and witches
It’s easy to poke fun at such prissy parental responses but take a closer look at Dahl’s writing for children, and you’ll find something to offend almost everyone
 If he was a bigot, he was an equal-opportunities bigot
 Teachers tend to be villainous, and even when benign, fail to impart any real wisdom
 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’s Oompa Loompas were originally depicted as small black pygmies with warlike cries
 Female characters tend to be either warm or wicked with nothing in between, while Revolting Rhymes brands Cinderella, that fairytale girl-next-door, “a dirty slut”
Wonka

Maria Nikolajeva, professor of children's literature at the University of Cambridge, disputes the notion that there is any darkness in Dahl’s books for younger readers
 “He is one of the most colourful and light-hearted children's writers”, she insists
 But for all the funniness and dazzling linguistic acrobatics of his prose, she acknowledges that there are problems with his vision
 Consider Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
“Wonka is vegetarian and only eats healthy food, but he seduces children with sweets
 It's highly immoral”, she says
 And then there’s The Witches, whose child narrator, having been turned into a mouse, decides against returning to his human form because he dreads outliving his beloved grandmother
 He’d rather die with her, as his abbreviated rodent lifespan will guarantee
 “This is a denial of growing up and mortality, but mortality is one of the aspects that makes us human”, Nikolajeva points out
 “To tell young readers that you can escape growing up by dying is dubious  – drawn to the utmost an encouragement of suicide – and therefore both an ideological and an aesthetic flaw”
Dahl knew what his readership liked: the kind of filthsome, frightsome fare that makes kiddles squirm
Yet there’s no denying that Dahl knew just what his juvenile readership liked: chocolate and witches and – to borrow some Gobblefunk, the language he invented for his Big Friendly Giant – the kind of filthsome, frightsome fare that makes kiddles squirm with gleeful revulsion
 “Children love disgusting stories”, Nikolajeva says
 The revolting serves “an important cognitive-affective function: we know it's disgusting, and the knowledge makes us superior
 It's healthy
 But it must be disgusting in combination with humour
 Because extreme violence is not healthy
 But Dahl is never violent, not even with naughty children in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
”  
‘Roald the Rotten’
Darkness, for want of a better word, has forever been a secret – and not so secret – ingredient in children’s literature, whether it’s tales by the Brothers Grimm and Heinrich Hoffmann, or Lord of the Flies and The Hunger Games
 If you’ve ever paid attention to the words of a nursery rhyme like Ring a Ring o’ Roses or Oranges and Lemons, you’ll know that suckling babes are reared on it – and with good reason
 As child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim explained in his seminal study, The Uses of Enchantment, the macabre in children’s literature serves an important cathartic function
 “Without such fantasies, the child fails to get to know his monster better, nor is he given suggestions as to how he may gain mastery over it
 As a result, the child remains helpless with his worst anxieties – much more so than if he had been told fairy tales which give these anxieties form and body and also show ways to overcome these monsters,” he wrote
BFG 
Dahl invented his nonsense language, Gobblefunk for The BFG (Credit: Illustrations ©Quentin Blake) 
It’s not hard to see where Dahl might have drawn his own darkness from
 Having lost his older sister and father when he was three years old, he was packed off to boarding school aged just nine
 The first volume of his memoirs, Boy, recalls in great detail the headmaster’s penchant for floggings so vicious they drew blood
As a young RAF pilot in World War Two, Dahl came close to dying
 Invalided out after crash landing in the Western Desert, he spent the rest of the war in the US, seducing heiresses and wealthy widows in the name of counterintelligence
 His first marriage, to the actress and celebrated beauty Patricia Neal, had far from a storybook ending
 The couple lost their eldest daughter to illness, and their only son was left brain damaged by a traffic accident
 A few years later, Neal herself suffered a series of strokes
To write brilliantly for children, an author must retain an element of the childlike – sometimes, that blurs into childishness
It was Neal who coined the nickname ‘Roald the Rotten’, referring to a mean, dyspeptic streak of which she saw plenty
 He cheated on her, and the years-long affair that would eventually end their marriage was with a friend of hers
 He could be a thoroughly unpleasant man outside the home, too
 Despite his towering success, he was chippy about being a children’s author
 And he made no attempt to hide his anti-Semitism
 In 1983, he announced in the New Statesman that Hitler had his reasons for exterminating six million men, women and children
 “There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity”, he said
 “I mean, there’s always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick on them for no reason
”
Matilda 
Villains like Matilda’s Miss Trunchbull loom large in his books, towering over pint-sized protagonists (Credit: Illustrations ©Quentin Blake)
Read enough along these lines (there’s plenty more out there) and the sprightly horror of Dahl’s narratives no longer slips down quite so easily
 Should we let this ruin his writing for us
 Nikolajeva is unequivocal: “Frankly, I don't care about writers as real people”, she says
 “If Dahl had been a sweet, benevolent storyteller would he have survived at all
 Who wants sweet, benevolent stories
”
There was undoubtedly an element of provocation in much of his nastiness, both on and off the page
 As the lives of the likes of Lewis Carroll, Margaret Wise Brown, and CS Lewis illustrate, to write brilliantly for children, an author must retain an element of the childlike
 Sometimes, that blurs into childishness
 To quote Dahl himself, the children’s author “must like simple tricks and jokes and riddles and other childish things”
But it’s also worth recalling this: though childlike has come to refer to positive qualities associated with children, at its most basic, it simply means resembling a child
 And as the magnificent Maurice Sendak observed, “In plain terms, a child is a complicated creature who can drive you crazy
 There's a cruelty to childhood, there's an anger
” If Dahl’s books contain just one message for us adults, it’s the reminder that a child’s world isn’t all sweetness and light, it contains shadows too – extravagant, scary, wickedly entertaining ones

 These bizarre and terrifying visions are found in the Augsburg Book of Miraculous Signs, also called the Book of Miracles
 It is a beautifully illustrated manuscript created in the German city in the mid-16th Century but only recently discovered and now collected in a new edition, by Till-Holger Borchert and Joshua P Waterman

“I remember that when I first saw the images in the flesh,” Till-Holger Borchert tells BBC Culture, “I was awestruck by the very touching combination of simplicity and beauty in systematically depicting catastrophes of all times
”
“These stunningly vivid pictures must certainly have imparted to those readers first seeing them a sense of awe at the progression of disasters and wonders from the beginning of history to the end of time, as then understood,” writes Waterman
 The first half of the book concerns the Old Testament, while the second spans from antiquity through to the mid 1500s, when the book was produced
 It ends with stories from the Book of Revelation
Feel the burn

Each image, such as 1009 - Burning torch, is accompanied by a caption that leaves no doubt as to its grim message: “In the year AD 1009, the sun went dark and the moon was seen all blood­red and a great earthquake struck and there fell from the sky with a loud and crashing noise a huge burning torch like a column or a tower
 This was followed by the death of many people and famine throughout Germany and Italy
 More people died than remained alive
”
By drawing from ancient, biblical and contemporary traditions of prophecy in roughly chronological order, The Book of Miracles follows an established structure similar to other contemporary books of wonders
 It’s a tradition that highlights the period’s ordering of history through the prism of apocalyptic signs and visions
 “When studying this one-of-a-kind series of illustrations,” Waterman says, “it’s important to keep in mind the structuring principle of Christian world history
”
“The 16th Century’s obsession with miraculous signs has its primary origin in religion, specifically in the upheavals of the Protestant Reformation,” he notes
 Borchert agrees
 “The late medieval councils had left Christendom in an insecure state, and the Reformation tried to fill the void,” he explains
 “There was a general sense and urgency concerning the afterlife and the best way to secure one’s fate
” A widespread and imminent sense of disaster “created a sphere of anxiety in which those miraculous signs played an important role
”
The ‘Papal Ass’

Many of the book’s images, such as the 1496 Tiber monster, have their origins in contemporary folklore: a monster was said to have been found in Rome on the banks of the Tiber after a flood of 1496
 But, Waterman says the beast is also “the prime example” of phenomena that he says were “put to propagandistic or polemical use
” In 1523, Martin Luther and his colleague Philipp Melanchthon published a pamphlet in which they depicted the donkey-like creature as the ‘Papal Ass’, to represent the corruption of the Roman Catholic church
“Scholarship has identified a strong apocalyptic slant in the thinking of Martin Luther and in early Lutheranism in general” Waterman explains, “fueled in part by a belief that the antichrist was present on earth in the person of the Pope
”
But although apocalyptic Lutheranism helps to place The Augsburg Book of Miracles firmly in its time, Luther’s polemical version of the Tiber monster story, Waterman explains, is entirely absent from the document
 “Augsburg was a free imperial city, thus directly subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor… For that reason, anti-Catholic polemics were in no way advantageous to Augsburg’s elites
” 
The Lisbon whale

“In the year 1531, on the twenty­sixth and the twenty­eighth of January, bloody and fiery signs were seen at night in the sky in Lisbon in Portugal on the twenty­sixth day and then on the twenty­eighth a great whale was seen in the sky
 This was followed by great earthquakes, so that about two hundred houses collapsed and more than a thousand people were killed
”
The ‘Lisbon whale’ demonstrates how stories were disseminated across Europe through media including letters and pamphlets, in what Waterman describes as “the earliest forms of modern news networks,” that ran along existing trade routes
 He cites the ‘Fugger newsletters’ (Fuggerzeitungen), named after the Augbsurg-based Fugger family, as the prime example of “handwritten newspapers with reports of noteworthy events in Europe and abroad, including disasters and miraculous phenomena
” The sighting of the Lisbon whale, which was followed by several disasters, is one such story where the news was first transmitted by letter and then into print and illustrated media, including the Augsburg Book of Miracles
Celestial creatures

“In the year 1506, a comet appeared for several nights and turned its tail towards Spain
 In this year, a lot of fruit grew and was completely destroyed by caterpillars or rats
 This was followed eight and nine years later, in this country and in Italy, by an earthquake, so great and violent that in Constantinople a great many buildings were knocked down and people perished
”
A contemporary preoccupation with astrological prophecy helps to explain why documents such as the Book of Miracles abound with suns and moons, and particularly comets, which were in antiquity considered harbingers of doom
 “Authors such as Johannes Virdung von Haßfurt (1463–1538/39) published yearly predictions of world affairs based on sightings of comets and conjunctions of celestial bodies,” writes Waterman, and he notes that along with a “treatise” on the subject published around 1587 in Flanders, the Augsburg Book of Miracles represents the largest early collection of comet pictures
The comet images in the Book of Miracles often appear accompanied by natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and plagues which Waterman explains were all “understood as part of a continuum of divine omens that foretold the coming apocalypse and called upon humanity to do penance for their sins
”
All hail

“In AD 1552, on May 17, such a terrible storm with hail descended on Dordrecht in Holland, that the people thought the Day of Judgement was coming
 And it lasted about half an hour
 Several of the stones weighed up to a few pounds and 8 lot
 And where they fell, they gave a frightful stench
”
The hailstorm that visited the town of Dordrecht in 1552 is the most recent of the events noted in the Augsburg Book of Miracles
 The illustrations of violent hail and snowstorms are considered some of the earliest depictions of weather in German art
“It was not uncommon for extreme meteorological phenomena such as hail, snow and ice to devastate crops and lead to famine and epidemics in their own right,” writes Waterman
 It is therefore understandable that these wild and devastating natural disasters would be linked with the apocalyptic consciousness of the era
Fantastic beasts
(Credit: The Book of Miracles / Taschen)
The final section of the book, inspired by the prophecies of the Book of Revelation, is to Waterman, “a clear example of how wondrous phenomena fit within a comprehensive ordering scheme of world history, understood as a progression from God’s act of creation to the second coming of Jesus Christ
”
The Augsburg Book of Miracles is a fascinating glimpse into an atmosphere of superstition and apocalyptic prophecy
 But rather than dismiss these views as bizarre medieval preoccupations, Waterman argues that “it’s easy empathise with the 16th Century’s efforts to understand strange, inexplicable, or disastrous events in the world, even if our modern understanding is drastically different
”
Age of anxiety
(Credit: The Book of Miracles / Taschen)
And, in that society’s “sphere of anxiety”, Borchert sees some parallels with today, in that “every extreme weather phenomenon is hailed in news as proof of climate change and these days, every attack everywhere is almost instantly linked to terrorism
” 
Yet this concern with weather and natural phenomena provides a more concerning link between the mid-1500s and today, Waterman says
 “Thinking about environmental catastrophes back then and now, one becomes aware of a cruel irony: whereas human sin was once blamed for floods, storms, and droughts, only to have been replaced by scientific explanations after the Enlightenment, we have now, with global warming, come full circle
”“The most influential teacher since Socrates” is how one leading contemporary composer describes Nadia Boulanger
 As unlikely as it seems, this unassuming-looking lady of Romanian, Russian and French heritage, who was born in 1887 and lived to the age of 92, did indeed end up shaping the sound of the modern world
Boulanger was the first woman to conduct many major US and European orchestras
Her roster of music students reads like the ultimate 20th Century Hall of Fame
 Leonard Bernstein
 Aaron Copland
 Quincy Jones
 Astor Piazzolla
 Philip Glass
 John Eliot Gardiner
 Daniel Barenboim
 Elliott Carter
 All these musical giants, so different yet so groundbreaking in their own ways, studied with Boulanger
 She gave them a rigorous grounding in academic musical analysis, yet somehow enabled each of them to find their own distinct language: perhaps the very definition of what makes a great teacher
(Credit: Getty Images)

It is no exaggeration, then, to consider Boulanger the most important musical pedagogue of the modern – or indeed any – era
 Although her teaching base was in the family apartment at 36 Rue Ballu in the ninth arrondisement of Paris, she also taught in the US and UK, working with leading conservatoires including the Juilliard School, the Yehudi Menuhin School, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music
With such a contribution, she might also arguably be described as the most important woman in the history of classical music
 Not that she’d appreciate attention being drawn to her gender
 Being female was, for Boulanger, no apparent barrier to achievement
 In addition to her remarkable teaching career, she became the first woman to conduct many of the major US and European symphony orchestras, including the BBC Symphony, Boston Symphony, Hallé Orchestra and New York Philharmonic
 Boulanger was also a mentor to Igor Stravinsky and an ardent champion of his music when much of the musical world remained unconvinced of its genius
 She was responsible for bringing to life a number of ground-breaking world premieres
Hidden figure
But be honest: have you ever heard of her
 Boulanger’s name remains largely unknown outside niche classical music circles, despite the astonishing impact she had on the soundtrack to all our lives, not just in the realm of classical but in jazz, tango, funk and hip-hop
 It is frankly unimaginable that a man with a similar degree of influence over 20th Century music would have been so ignored

You can draw a line from the salons of early 20th Century Paris to Thriller
Yet Boulanger was no shrinking violet
 By all accounts she was a fierce, uncompromising and forceful woman: charismatic, loyal and passionate but also complex and complicated
 She was riven with envy for her younger sister Lili, a composer of genius who, at 19, had been the first woman ever to win the prestigious Prix de Rome competition but by 24 was dead of intestinal tuberculosis (now known as Crohn’s Disease)
 Nadia, like Lili, had also entered the Paris Conservatoire to study composition at the tender age of 10, but she never received much acclaim as a composer
 After Lili’s death, rather than allowing her talented late sister’s name to fade, as many jealous siblings might have, she made it a mission of her life and career to ceaselessly promote and champion Lili’s musical genius, programming her works alongside more canonical repertoire right up until the end of her career

It’s quite a stretch to make the imaginative leap from the salons of early 20th Century Paris to the disco-strewn beats of Quincy Jones, producer of choice for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Aretha Franklin to Michael Jackson
 But at last year’s BBC Proms, Q, as he is known, told me in all earnestness that he owed everything he was as a musician to his early instruction, in 1950s Paris, under Nadia Boulanger
 It tickles me to imagine what Boulanger – who died in 1979 – would have made of, say, Thriller, which Jones produced for Jackson three years later and which remains the top-selling album of all time, having shifted over 65 million copies
 But Q told me that Boulanger had a singular way of encouraging and eliciting each student’s own voice – even if they were not yet aware of what that voice might be

For a little old grey-haired French lady, she was also, he joked, terrifying
 “She used to tell me all the time: Quincy, your music can never be more, or less, than you are as a human being
 Unless you have the life experience and have something to say that you’ve lived, you have nothing to contribute at all… She was strong
 Really strong
”
We should raise a cheer to the woman who contributed so much, with so little fanfare, to the history of 20th and 21st Century music
 Don’t take my word for it
 “Nadia Boulanger,” says Quincy Jones, “was the most astounding woman I ever met in my life
” And he’s met a few
Over the weekend, I happened to go viral
 Or rather a single paragraph from a book I wrote called The Elements of Eloquence went viral
 The guilty paragraph went like this:
“Adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun
 So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife
 But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you’ll sound like a maniac
 It’s an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list, but almost none of us could write it out
”
English speakers love to learn this sort of thing for two reasons
 First, it astonishes us that there are rules that we didn’t know that we knew
 That’s rather peculiar, and rather exciting
 We’re all quite a lot cleverer than we think we are
 And there’s the shock of realising that there’s a reason there may be little green men on Mars, but there certainly aren’t green little men
 Second, you can spend the next hour of your life trying to think of exceptions, which is useful as it keeps you from doing something foolish like working
Actually, there are a couple of small exceptions
 Little Red Riding Hood may be perfectly ordered, but the Big Bad Wolf seems to be breaking all the laws of linguistics
 Why does Bad Big Wolf sound so very, very wrong
 What happened to the rules
Ding dong King Kong
Well, in fact, the Big Bad Wolf is just obeying another great linguistic law that every native English speaker knows, but doesn’t know that they know
 And it’s the same reason that you’ve never listened to hop-hip music
If somebody said ‘zag-zig’ or ‘cross-criss’ you would know they were breaking a rule
You are utterly familiar with the rule of ablaut reduplication
 You’ve been using it all your life
 It’s just that you’ve never heard of it
 But if somebody said the words zag-zig, or ‘cross-criss you would know, deep down in your loins, that they were breaking a sacred rule of language
 You just wouldn’t know which one
All four of a horse’s feet make exactly the same sound
 But we always, always say clip-clop, never clop-clip
 Every second your watch (or the grandfather clock in the hall makes the same sound) but we say tick-tock, never tock-tick
 You will never eat a Kat Kit bar
 The bells in Frère Jaques will forever chime ‘ding dang dong’
Reduplication in linguistics is when you repeat a word, sometimes with an altered consonant (lovey-dovey, fuddy-duddy, nitty-gritty), and sometimes with an altered vowel: bish-bash-bosh, ding-dang-dong
 If there are three words then the order has to go I, A, O
 If there are two words then the first is I and the second is either A or O
 Mish-mash, chit-chat, dilly-dally, shilly-shally, tip top, hip-hop, flip-flop, tic tac, sing song, ding dong, King Kong, ping pong
Why this should be is a subject of endless debate among linguists, it might be to do with the movement of your tongue or an ancient language of the Caucasus
 It doesn’t matter
 It’s the law, and, as with the adjectives, you knew it even if you didn’t know you knew it
 And the law is so important that you just can’t have a Bad Big Wolf
Tense situations
It’s astonishing quite how expert you are at the English language
 There are so many tenses you can use without even thinking about it, and almost certainly without being able to name them
 It depends how you count them, but there are about 20 that you deploy faultlessly
 The pluperfect progressive passive for an extended state of action that happened to you prior to another action in the past is, when you put it like that, rather daunting
 But then you’d happily say “I realised I’d been being watched” without breaking sweat or blinking
 Think how daunting this is for people learning English
 The teacher has to explain to them that the English don’t usually use the present tense for things that are happening in the present
 “I brush my teeth” doesn’t mean that you’re doing it right now, it just means that you do it regularly
 For things that are actually happening right now you use the present progressive “I’m brushing my teeth” (but only if you can speak with your mouth full)
We actually have a tense called the future present – imagine having to learn that
And having learnt that you then have to learn that there are certain exceptions, like the verb ‘to think’ used as an auxiliary, as in “I think you’re right”
 This is why, incidentally, lots of non-native speakers will use phrases like “I am thinking that you are right”
 It sounds faintly comic to us, but we had years and years and years of immersion learning just to get all these subtleties
 And English is complex and weird
 We actually have a tense called the Future Present
 Imagine having to learn that
 But for us it’s just “The train leaves tomorrow
”
Some rules we really should know
 It’s surprising and dispiriting how many English people don’t know the rules of stress, because that’s how all our poetry works
 It’s quite easy really, and we can hear it in other languages
 Everyone knows that Italian has rhythm, it goes MAM-a MI-a BUON-a SER-a
 But so does our language
 And that’s how verse works
 I can illustrate with my favourite limerick (or at least my favourite clean one)
 Try reading this aloud:
There was a young man from Dundee
Got stung on the leg by a wasp
When asked does it hurt
He said ‘Yes it does
‘I’m so glad it wasn’t a hornet
’
That has no rhymes, but it still works as a limerick because rhymes aren’t nearly as important as rhythm
 And the rhythm goes:
de-DUM-de, de-DUM-de, de-DUM
de-DUM-de, de-DUM-de, de-DUM
de-DUM-de, de-DUM
de-DUM-de, de-DUM
de-DUM-de, de-DUM-de, de-DUM-de
In a strong French accent, there’s no difference between happiness and a penis
Which only works because we know to pronounce Dundee as ‘dun-DEE’, and not to rhyme with Grundy or the Isle of Lundy
 It’s the subtle difference when we record a record or present a present or tell a rebel to rebel
 It’s a difference that is very hard for people to learn, and is the main reason that, in a strong French accent, there’s no difference between happiness and a penis
English is an immensely complicated language to get right, and native speakers often have no idea of its strangeness
 We understand the sentence “I can’t put up with the guy I’m putting up at my house, his put-downs really put me out and I’m feeling put-upon”
 Or “I’m doing up my house and it’s doing me in
” Literally, that should mean “I’m performing my house skywards and it’s performing me towards the interior”
 These are called phrasal verbs and they are the nightmare of every would-be English speaker
 Somebody once said of Ian Fleming that he got off with women because he couldn’t get on with them
 To us that’s a simple joke, to a learner who also has to get through, get by, get down, get with it, get up… it does their head in
English is largely made up of the rules we don’t know that we know
 And actually the rules we know we know are a rarity
 We can cling to a few of them at least
 At least we all know that we know that adjectives have comparatives and superlatives
 Big, bigger, biggest
 Hot, hotter, hottest
 Easy, easier, easiest
 It’s comforting
 It’s reliable
 It’s something we know that we know
But can you do it with an adjective that’s three syllables long
Curiouser and curiouser
In theory, the artist and the reporter have little in common beyond a determination to communicate
 Where the artist’s self can never be disentangled from his or her work (“how can we know the dancer from the dance
”, as the Irish poet William Butler Yeats once asked), journalistic ethics dictate that a reporter’s identity must never encroach upon the story he or she is telling
 One is the epitome of subjectivity, the other of objectivity
 But theories exist to be disproved, as extraordinary footage captured this week on the outskirts of the Syrian city of Aleppo poignantly reveals
In the Frame
Each week Kelly Grovier takes a photo from the news and likens it to a great work of art
Read more from In the Frame
At a scene of devastation, where a bomb had just ignited chaos, the Syrian photojournalist Abd Alkader Habak found himself forced to choose between remaining separate from the unfolding events or setting his camera aside and inserting himself into the action
 It was the sight of a child lying face down, hurled from the blast, that tipped the balance for Habak
 Presumed dead by bystanders, the boy caught Habak’s attention when the photographer noticed his hand move slightly
 Suddenly, Habak was running with the boy in his arms to the safety of an ambulance only to return, moments later, to rescue a little girl who was crying for help

Captured in mid-stride, the reporter had become the reported – the image-maker became the image
 Footage of Habak saving these children recalls another moving portrait of heroic humanity
 In 1854, the English painter John Everett Millais found himself called to preserve an image of courage he believed might otherwise go unheralded
 The result would be a profile in courage that would help define fearlessness in the popular imagination for a generation
Mesmerised by the sight of a nearby blaze in the early morning sky, so the story goes, Millais instructed a cab driver to head in the direction of the fire
 When the artist and his brother arrived at the scene, he was transfixed by the gallantry of a pair of firemen, perched precariously on a weakening beam (“two black silhouettes against the mass of heaving flame”, as Millais’s brother would later recall) and attacking the fire with a hose, when suddenly the roof broke – “carrying with it the rafter and the two brave men”
(Credit: Wikipedia)
John Everett Millais painted The Rescue (1855) after witnessing the death of a fireman in the course of his duties (Credit: Wikipedia)
Moved by the dreadful events (and “the shout of horror that rent the air”), Millais was determined to honour the unsung fire fighters, arguing that “Soldiers and sailors have been praised on canvas a thousand times
 My next picture shall be of the fireman
” To do so, Millais painstakingly reconstructed in his studio the atmosphere of the smouldering scene, alchemising ingeniously from sheets of coloured glass and burnt wooden planks the lethal claustrophobia of smoke and fear
 The result is the gleaming portrait The Rescue (1855)
 Millais hired a model to play the role of the sturdy fireman, whose chiselled physique was lumbered with the weight of three children: two on his back and one under his arm
In the ensuing years, Millais would seize every opportunity he could to accompany his friend, the chief of the fire brigade, to the countless fires erupting around London
 It was a time when the brigade was becoming a public institution, dedicated to protecting human life rather than simply preserving property from damage
 When placed alongside this week’s photo from Syria, The Rescue can be seen as a kind of fantasised self-portrait of the artist doing what Millais couldn’t on that fateful morning – and what Habak did this week: rescuing something far more vital and precious than any image
“Stunned silence” was the audience reaction to a performance art piece by the Neo Naturists at London’s grand Royal Opera House, says artist Wilma Johnson, one of the group’s founder members
 The naked cheer-leading routine with body paint and pom-poms left the entire venue in shock
 The live-art group had been invited to perform at the fund-raising event by the ballet dancer and choreographer Michael Clark
 It is Johnson’s favourite memory from the time
 “When I was a kid I was chucked out of ballet school because I was really gawky,” she tells BBC Culture, “so to silence the Royal Opera House was amazing
”

The Neo Naturists blazed a naked trail of disruption, confrontation, chaos and confusion through the 1980s London underground art scene, creating their nude happenings in front of bemused audiences at clubs, galleries and various public places, where the women often arrived unannounced, launching into their performance guerrilla style
 Wild, non-conformist and provocative, the group was nevertheless largely forgotten, but is now being rediscovered, and has reformed for a retrospective of their work at the Studio Voltaire gallery in London
 The exhibition incorporates film and photographs, as well as live performance – though not completely naked this time around
By all accounts, the group’s performances were surreally humorous
 Christine Binnie who, along with her sister Jennifer and Wilma Johnson, founded the group, recalls performing a live tableau of “fishermen and mermaids” outside the landmark Centrepoint building in central London
 The performance attracted a lot of attention, she remembers, including that of the police: “We had a conversation with a policeman for about 10 minutes, but in the end he didn’t arrest us, just told us to put our coats on
” Until recently, a law from the Victorian era still stood in England – it was only men, not women, who were prevented by law from exposing themselves in public
A law from the Victorian era still stands in England – it is only men, not women, who are prevented by law from exposing themselves in public
The three women collaborated with and were part of a wider creative and social circle in London
 Some of them went on to achieve considerable success – among them Michael Clark, artist Grayson Perry, singer Boy George, and film-makers Derek Jarman and John Maybury
 Flamboyant would be an understatement for this loose collective of artists, art-school students, clubbers, performers and drag queens who were among the originators of the New Romantic movement, and also occasionally known as the Blitz kids
Swimming and Walking

As Jennifer Binnie puts it: “We were part of a mostly gay scene and the openness of that scene was what allowed us to do what we did
 It was an expression of our own femininity
” Wearing nothing but body paint was also a way for the three women to keep up and to be ever more outrageous, shocking, out-there and radical
 Grayson Perry particularly was a key collaborator at the time, and took part in many of the women’s performances, later describing the Neo Naturists as “true bohemians
”
Body talk
Certainly the trio embraced bohemian ideals from early on
 For Christine, a visit to Germany in the late 1970s was the initial spark of inspiration
 “The German punks were all sunbathing nude around the lake, whereas in Britain the punks were very pale, wore black and stayed indoors
” The Binnie sisters had been brought up by their artistic parents to believe in “being natural”
 Freedom of expression was encouraged at home, with crafts and organic food a part of everyday life
 “We’re all quite outdoorsy,” says Christine
 The sisters’ childhood also involved membership of the Girl Guides, and their early love of camping subsequently found its way into one of their Neo-Naturist performances featuring a nude cooking ritual with a Calor-gas camping stove

Although always done with a sense of fun and humour, there was – and is – a serious point to the performances
 “It was to do with freedom and showing female bodies the way they really were,” says Christine
 “In a broad sense the three of us didn’t fit in because all the other girls on that scene were very heavily made up and dressed up, and the men were heavily stylised and aesthetically very beautiful too
  Our style was more messy, more expressive
 We weren’t conforming, and we weren’t titillating
 It was about freedom and expression
” The group also confronted some of the more joyless aspects of the era’s feminist movement
 “We questioned whether feminists were always empowering to women,” says Jennifer
 “In the late 1970s and early ‘80s we didn’t fit into the feminist ideal - we wore feather boas and body paint, and we were funny
”

The Binnie sisters have since worked as ceramicists, and Wilma Johnson is now a “practising surfer” who lives on a naturist beach in France and has written a book, Surf Mama, about her life
 The three have remained friends through the decades
 “The thing that was and is the most powerful about what we do is that we never do it alone,” says Christine
 “We did it in a group which made us daring and we became this one powerful unit, so that’s part of the reason we came back together for this show
 When you get to a certain age as a woman you start to feel invisible
 People don’t even notice you
”
Naked ambitions
Needless to say, nakedness has always had a power to shock, titillate or make us laugh – as streakers at sporting and other public events have proved over the decades
 Naturists and nudists meanwhile have traditionally been a figure of fun
 But increasingly nakedness is being used in other contexts too
 The artist Spencer Tunick creates extraordinary, living pieces of art using thousands of unclothed human models, most recently with more than 3,000 naked volunteers covered in blue body paint - for a large-scale art-work in Hull in anticipation of its year as the City of Culture in 2017

Meanwhile, a recent TV programme and one-off social experiment on the UK’s Channel 4, Life Stripped Bare, explores how a group of people react to having all of their possessions, including clothes, removed for three weeks
 And nudity or semi-nudity as a form of protest continues to be powerful – the recent World Naked Bike Ride was an international ‘clothing-optional’ protest about lack of road safety for cyclists
We weren’t conforming, and we weren’t titillating
 It was about freedom and expression – Christine Binnie
And of course there is Ukrainian activist group Femen and Russian punk protest group Pussy Riot, who have both made toplessness their trademark
 Jessica Vaughan, the curator of the Neo-Naturist exhibition, argues that what the Binnies and Johnson were doing in the 1980s was ahead of its time and unfairly written out of history: “There is Femen and Pussy Riot, but the Neo Naturists were completely naked, they were ground-breaking,” she tells BBC Culture
 “And they were under-represented in the 1980s, maybe because the scene they were involved in was dominated by men who were important figures
 They worked alongside those figures but in an oppositional way - they were more messy, and more chaotic than the sometimes po-faced New Romantics
”
Femen

The Neo Naturists are just as relevant now, if not more so, the 30-year-old curator argues: “I think there’s even more pressure now on women to conform to certain body images, to look airbrushed, smooth and hair-free
 The Neo Naturists were the opposite of that
 I can’t imagine seeing such voluptuous women naked in public now
 Everything is manipulated and edited to perfection in the media and on social media
 There was a sense of fun, authenticity and spontaneity about the way they just went out to see what reaction they would get from the public
 There was an innocence and joyfulness about them
”Talk of ‘us’ and ‘them’ has long dominated Iran-related politics in the West
 At the same time, Christianity has frequently been used to define the identity and values of the US and Europe, as well as to contrast those values with those of a Middle Eastern ‘other’
 Yet, a brief glance at an ancient religion – still being practised today – suggests that what many take for granted as wholesome Western ideals, beliefs and culture may in fact have Iranian roots
Even the idea of Satan is a fundamentally Zoroastrian one
It is generally believed by scholars that the ancient Iranian prophet Zarathustra (known in Persian as Zartosht and Greek as Zoroaster) lived sometime between 1500 and 1000 BC
 Prior to Zarathustra, the ancient Persians worshipped the deities of the old Irano-Aryan religion, a counterpart to the Indo-Aryan religion that would come to be known as Hinduism
 Zarathustra, however, condemned this practice, and preached that God alone – Ahura Mazda, the Lord of Wisdom – should be worshipped
 In doing so, he not only contributed to the great divide between the Iranian and Indian Aryans, but arguably introduced to mankind its first monotheistic faith
(Credit: Alamy)
Zoroaster likely lived between 1500 and 1000 BC, but some scholarship suggests he may have been a contemporary of Persian emperors Cyrus the Great and Darius I (Credit: Alamy)
The idea of a single god was not the only essentially Zoroastrian tenet to find its way into other major faiths, most notably the ‘big three’: Judaism, Christianity and Islam
 The concepts of Heaven and Hell, Judgment Day and the final revelation of the world, and angels and demons all originated in the teachings of Zarathustra, as well as the later canon of Zoroastrian literature they inspired
 Even the idea of Satan is a fundamentally Zoroastrian one; in fact, the entire faith of Zoroastrianism is predicated on the struggle between God and the forces of goodness and light (represented by the Holy Spirit, Spenta Manyu) and Ahriman, who presides over the forces of darkness and evil
 While man has to choose to which side he belongs, the religion teaches that ultimately, God will prevail, and even those condemned to hellfire will enjoy the blessings of Paradise (an Old Persian word)
(Credit: Alamy)
Zoroastrianism may have been the first monotheistic religion, and its emphasis on dualities, such as heaven and hell, appear in Judaism, Christianity and Islam (Credit: Alamy)
How did Zoroastrian ideas find their way into the Abrahamic faiths and elsewhere
 According to scholars, many of these concepts were introduced to the Jews of Babylon upon being liberated by the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great
 They trickled into mainstream Jewish thought, and figures like Beelzebub emerged
 And after Persia’s conquests of Greek lands during the heyday of the Achaemenid Empire, Greek philosophy took a different course
 The Greeks had previously believed humans had little agency, and that their fates were at the mercy of their many gods, who often acted according to whim and fancy
 After their acquaintance with Iranian religion and philosophy, however, they began to feel more as if they were the masters of their destinies, and that their decisions were in their own hands
Could Dante have been influenced by Zoroastrianism
Though it was once the state religion of Iran and widely practised in other regions inhabited by Persian peoples (eg Afghanistan, Tajikistan and much of Central Asia), Zoroastrianism is today a minority religion in Iran, and boasts few adherents worldwide
 The religion’s cultural legacy, however, is another matter
 Many Zoroastrian traditions continue to underpin and distinguish Iranian culture, and outside the country, it has also had a noted impact, particularly in Western Europe
Zoroastrian rhapsody
Centuries before Dante’s Divine Comedy, the Book of Arda Virafdescribed in vivid detail a journey to Heaven and Hell
 Could Dante have possibly heard about the cosmic Zoroastrian traveller’s report, which assumed its final form around the 10th Century AD
 The similarity of the two works is uncanny, but one can only offer hypotheses

Elsewhere, however, the Zoroastrian ‘connection’ is less murky

 Likewise, the Clavis Artis, a late 17th/early 18th-Century German work on alchemy was dedicated to Zarathustra, and featured numerous Christian-themed depictions of him
 Zoroaster “came to be regarded [in Christian Europe] as a master of magic, a philosopher and an astrologer, especially after the Renaissance," says Ursula Sims-Williams of the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London

Today, mention of the name Zadig immediately brings to mind the French fashion label Zadig & Voltaire
 While the clothes may not be Zoroastrian, the story behind the name certainly is
 Written in the mid-18th Century by none other than Voltaire, Zadigtells the tale of its eponymous Persian Zoroastrian hero, who, after a series of trials and tribulations, ultimately weds a Babylonian princess
 Although flippant at times and not rooted in history, Voltaire’s philosophical tale sprouted from a genuine interest in Iran also shared by other leaders of the Enlightenment
 So enamoured with Iranian culture was Voltaire that he was known in his circles as ‘Sa’di’
 In the same spirit, Goethe’s West-East Divan, dedicated to the Persian poet Hafez, featured a Zoroastrian-themed chapter, while Thomas Moore lamented the fate of Iran’s Zoroastrians in Lalla Rookh
Freddie Mercury was intensely proud of his Persian Zoroastrian heritage
It wasn’t only in Western art and literature that Zoroastrianism made its mark; indeed, the ancient faith also made a number of musical appearances on the European stage
In addition to the priestly character Sarastro, the libretto of Mozart’s The Magic Flute is laden with Zoroastrian themes, such as light versus darkness, trials by fire and water, and the pursuit of wisdom and goodness above all else
 And the late Farrokh Bulsara – aka Freddie Mercury – was intensely proud of his Persian Zoroastrian heritage
 “I’ll always walk around like a Persian popinjay,” he once remarked in an interview, “and no one’s gonna stop me, honey
” Likewise, his sister Kashmira Cooke in a 2014 interview reflected on the role of Zoroastrianism in the family
 “We as a family were very proud of being Zoroastrian,” she said
 “I think what [Freddie’s] Zoroastrian faith gave him was to work hard, to persevere, and to follow your dreams
”
Ice and fire
When it comes to music, though, perhaps no single example best reflects the influence of Zoroastrianism’s legacy than Richard Strauss’ Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which famously provided the booming backbone to much of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey
 The score owes its inspiration to Nietzsche’s magnum opus of the same name, which follows a prophet named Zarathustra, although many of the ideas Nietzsche proposes are, in fact, anti-Zoroastrian

Freddie Mercury and Zadig & Voltaire aside, there are other overt examples of Zoroastrianism’s impact on contemporary popular culture in the West
 Ahura Mazda served as the namesake for the Mazda car company, as well as the inspiration for the legend of Azor Ahai – a demigod who triumphs over darkness – in George RR Martin’s Game of Thrones, as many of its fans discovered last year
 As well, one could well argue that the cosmic battle between the Light and Dark sides of the Force in Star Wars has, quite ostensibly, Zoroastrianism written all over it

For all its contributions to Western thought, religion and culture, relatively little is known about the world’s first monotheistic faith and its Iranian founder
 In the mainstream, and to many US and European politicians, Iran is assumed to be the polar opposite of everything the free world stands for and champions
 Iran’s many other legacies and influences aside, the all but forgotten religion of Zoroastrianism just might provide the key to understanding how similar ‘we’ are to ‘them’
If a book is all about happy families, a picture of an ideal bond between siblings is all well and good
 Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth March in Little Women or the Bennett sisters in Pride and Prejudice, for example; the Radlett girls in Nancy Mitford’s The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, or Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy in that beloved children’s classic, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
When it comes to stories that set out to chill and thrill, however, nothing can beat a toxic sibling relationship
 From Cain and Abel, through Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov, and Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes, sibling rivalry is a dynamic that’s fuelled stories since people have been writing them
 But it looks like 2017 is the year that noir writers embrace the sibling thriller en masse, with sisters taking centre stage
 A whole host of forthcoming thrillers take a sibling relationship as their central theme
 Even Paula Hawkins, of The Girl on the Train fame, is getting in on the act; her eagerly anticipated second novel, Into the Water (May 2017), features a woman trying to reconcile shared events in her past following her sister’s mysterious and sudden death
Little Women 
Literature is filled with portraits of idealised bonds between siblings, such as Little Women and Pride and Prejudice (Credit: Alamy)
In the last few years the noir market has been dominated by the marriage thriller – remember Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl and SJ Watson’s Before I Go to Sleep
  It’s worth admiring how the best examples of this genre exploit the presumed sanctity and safety of the marital union, transforming the familiar and benign domestic environment into a haunted house full of secrets and menace
 However different each set-up, each of these stories hinges on the idea that you don’t know your partner as well as you think you do
 It’s not rocket science, but it is highly effective
 The sibling thriller, by comparison, offers a much broader canvas to explore
A sibling, perhaps even more than a marriage partner, should be someone you trust implicitly
Firstly, there’s drama to be found in the simple division of a sibling pair
 Although explored from the perspective of their mother, in Amy Gentry’s ‘novel of suspense’ Good as Gone, it’s 10-year-old Jane who’s the only witness to her older sister Julie’s kidnap, a twist of fate that renders her something akin to an accomplice in her grieving mother’s mind
 Meanwhile, a woman attempting to solve the mystery of her sister’s murder narrates Flynn Berry’s taut psychological thriller, Under the Harrow
 Obsessed with finding her beloved sister’s killer, Nora finds her own life on hold and in danger, unable to return to something resembling normal existence, let alone move on, until she uncovers the truth
 Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, but both Gentry and Berry demonstrate skills above and beyond the basic twists and turns needed for a thriller to function adequately
 Each understands the complexities of the sibling bond and uses this easily damaged but ultimately steadfast tie that binds to great effect
The Girl on the Train 
In recent years, domestic marriage thrillers have dominated the market, such as The Girl on the Train (Credit: Alamy)
The same opportunity for secrets, lies and betrayal as offered by the marriage thriller – a sibling, perhaps even more than a marriage partner, should be someone you can trust implicitly – intertwined with the additional gamut of jealousy and rivalry that so often plays out between two sisters
 Nuala Ellwood’s My Sister’s Bones was the first of this year’s offerings to explore the good v bad sister dynamic, a set-up also used by Michelle Adams in My Sister (April)
 Family secrets loom large in both novels, and while it’s ostensibly the parents who’ve kept secrets from their children, the focus is not on mending child-parent bonds (impossible since in each novel the action is kick-started by a parental death), instead they’re all about how these actions have affected the relationship between their offspring
Then there’s Chloé J Esposito’s Mad (June), the first in what’s purported to be a no-holds barred X-rated trilogy about “the lengths an identical twin will go to, to steal her sister’s perfect life and keep on living it
” Jealousy, betrayal and revenge are also the name of the game in Alice Feeney’s Sometimes I Lie and Isabel Ashdown’s Little Sister (July 2017)
 Feeney, through the use of the familiar figure of the unreliable narrator, not to mention the slow unfurling of the central protagonist’s childhood in parallel with the disturbing events unfolding in the present, has her reader wondering which sibling is which
 While Ashdown’s novel features the slow adoption of one sister’s life by the other: payback for a long-since-past betrayal, we eventually learn; everyone knows that revenge is a dish best served cold
Same difference
The psychoanalyst Juliet Mitchell argues that the trauma of the sibling relationship is the trauma of realising that you are not unique
 Sibling relationships are about sameness and difference and the first conundrum facing a child confronted with a baby brother or sister is that of reconciling these two apparently opposing states of being
 The new sibling is both the same as them – in the larger picture they’re in the same position in the broader family, especially in relation to their parents – but at the same time different from them
Paula Hawkins

Mitchell argues that in this situation the first born feels “displaced, deposed and without the place that was hers or his
” Her argument is one of position rather than of identity
 “The struggle,” she explains, “is not, ‘Who am I
’ but, ‘Where am I
’; not one of identity (though it is often confused with this) but of, ‘what is my position in this kinship scenario
’” What makes the sibling thriller so intriguing and so successful a genre is that it exploits this exact confusion
 The power of any thriller lies in its ability to tap into the horrors of one’s worst nightmares
 And these novels play out scenarios in which obliteration by the sibling is a terrifying reality
Sibling identity theft is both the ultimate horror story and the ultimate act of revenge
Ann Morgan’s Beside Myself spun this particular terror to great effect
 Published in 2016, it could be described as patient zero when it comes to this current literary trend
 Two identical six-year-old twins, Helen and Ellie, decide to swap places
 Their plan works brilliantly and they fool everyone, even their mother
 But when Helen – always the ringleader, mature for her age, bright, sweet and polite, “the good one” – grows bored of the joke and tells Ellie – the “problem child”, slow, messy, uncoordinated, prone to sullen moods – it’s time to swap back, Ellie refuses
 “I make up my mind to do everything I can to be my best possible Helen so that even with the rubbish Ellie hair and clothes, the real Helen-ness will shine through and Mother will have no choice but to know that it’s me,” Helen tries to reassure herself
The Brothers Karamazov 
Bitter rivalries and treachery among siblings also abound, such as in The Brothers Karamazov, shown here in a painting by Erich Heckel (Credit: Alamy)
Unfortunately though, this doesn’t work, and she finds herself trapped in a living nightmare, the irony being that in her growing frustration with the situation and her increasingly desperate attempts to convince people she’s the real Helen, she’s actually becoming more and more like the sister she’s trying so hard to convince everyone she’s not: irrational, badly-behaved and, as far as everyone else is concerned, a liar
 What Helen subsequently lives out – driven literally mad (as an adult she suffers from serious mental health issues) – is the fate that hangs so ominously over many of the victims in these sibling thrillers: Nora in Under the Harrow, Kate in My Sister’s Bones, Irini in My Sister, and Amber in Alice Feeney’s Sometimes I Lie
 Sibling identity theft is both the ultimate horror story and the ultimate act of revenge – it just depends who's who, victim or perpetrator
 A distinction that isn't always so easy to make
What are pillows really stuffed with
 Not physically, but symbolically
 The question occurred to me this week with the circulation in the news and social media of a flurry of photos from the 50 cities around the world that staged public celebrations for International Pillow Fight Day
 Armed with nothing more than bring-our-own sacrificial cushions, strangers walloped each other in blizzards of playful plumes from Amsterdam to Atlanta, Warsaw to Washington DC
 All told, thousands participated in the gleeful bash
 But why
 Is there anything more to this delightful duffing-up than smacks the eye
In the Frame
Each week Kelly Grovier takes a photo from the news and likens it to a great work of art

As a cultural sign, the pillow is deceptively soft
 After all, what could be less edgy than an object that is, by definition, cushy and filled with fluff
 And yet, since at least the 16th Century, the humble pillow has been rumpled into unexpected profundity
 The Chinese playwright Tang Xianzu who tells a famous story about a wise man who meets a despondent young scholar at an inn and offers him a magic pillow filled with the most vivid dreams of a seemingly more fulfilling life
 When the young man awakens to discover that his gratifying 50-year dream has in fact come and gone in the short space of an afternoon’s nap, our impression of the pillow’s power shifts from wonder to terror
Subsequent writers have likewise seized upon the pillow as more than merely a comfy metaphor for easy sleep
 When the 19th-Century English novelist Charlotte Brontë poetically observed “a ruffled mind makes a restless pillow”, she didn’t just scrunch up the expected order of the adjectives and nouns, but instead tossed-and-turned the sentence’s syntax in order to blur the boundaries between mind and matter – the thing resting and the thing rested upon
In Brontë’s phrase, the pillow and mind swap places and, for a instant, merge into the same substance
 It’s a trick perhaps she learned from the Renaissance philosopher Montaigne, who once insisted (with double-edged discomfort) that “ignorance is the softest pillow on which a man can rest his head”
 On the multi-textured mattress of Montaigne’s thinking, intelligence and happiness face off forever in an existential pillow fight that only one can win
 By Montaigne’s logic, there’s no sleep for the wickedly smart, only the invincibly stupid
With the words of Tang, Brontë, and Montaigne buffeting our brains, we can perhaps more easily measure the allure of the global fluff-tussle that broke out across the world this week
 Like a ritual of release, the annual international pillow fight amounts to a kind of cleansing, a brushing off of the fleeting flimflam of daily life: an emptying of the world’s collective mind
 Rather than a launch-pad for weightless rest, the pillow is a subliminal emblem of heavy thought: an anchor that drags the world’s soul down – one that must be lightened
The tension between feathers that tether and those that provide propulsion invigorates a masterpiece of modern art: Robert Rauschenberg’s enigmatic multi-media work Canyon, which the US artist created in 1959
 Hovering somewhere between painting and sculpture, readymade and collage, Canyon belongs to an idiosyncratic class of works Rauschenberg called ‘Combines’
 Against a hodgepodge of photos, abstract splotches, and patches of cloth, the taxidermied body of a salvaged bald eagle perches on a small box that in turn rests on a protruding plank – the feathers of the bird’s unfurling wings are endlessly poising for flight
 But the sense of outward movement that lifts the work’s spirit is counterbalanced by the strange, immeasurable weight of a pillow that sways surreally below the bottom edge of the Combine – dangling like the pendulum of a stopped clock
In Rauschenberg’s work, the pillow is not just a ballast, it exemplifies the fight between the soul’s urge for freedom and the inescapable forces that pull everything back to Earth
 Placed alongside the exultant photos from International Pillow Fight Day, Canyon reminds us what’s at stake if we never take time to pause and shake the feathers loose
In April 1917, everything changed
 At least, that is, in the world of art
 It was then that the legendary avant-garde French artist and cultural prankster, Marcel Duchamp, conceived a work so controversial in its making and meaning that it would alter forever the way the game of art is played
 The work in question was a porcelain urinal that Duchamp quizzically flipped onto its back, signed with a mysterious nom de plume, and called Fountain
 Like a genius move by a stealthy chess master, the introduction of Fountain into the history of image-making had the effect of check-mating the art world’s sensibilities, marking the end of one kind of game and the start of another
The analogy to chess is more than merely fanciful
 Insisting that it “has all the beauty of art and much more”, Duchamp was obsessed with the game
 (So obsessed in fact he forfeited significant pieces of his personal and creative life to its pursuit
 In November 1927, after having, years earlier, shifted his energies entirely from making art to playing chess, his new wife Lydie had had enough of his incessant strategizing of moves and countermoves
 One night, while he was sleeping, she glued the pieces of his set to the board
 They divorced a month later
) Duchamp’s mischievous creation of Fountain 100 years ago this month is deeply in accord with the artist’s lifelong inclination towards cerebral playfulness and demonstrates the same skilful sleights of hand that a grandmaster displays when wiping the board clean with his opponents
To understand how Duchamp managed to outmanoeuvre the art world, one needs to return to the moment that the scurrilous sculpture arrived for consideration at the recently formed Society of Independent Artists in New York in spring 1917, in advance of an exhibition due to open on 10 April
 As a founding member of the association, Duchamp had helped devise and articulate the organisation’s avant-garde ideology, including its commitment never to reject a work submitted by one of its members
 To test the sincerity and sturdiness of those principles, Duchamp entered the urinal under an assumed artistic identity - ‘R Mutt’ - knowing full well that the provocative piece would leave his fellow players in the society scrambling for their next move
Fountain gushes with conundra about the very nature of creation and what it means to be a maker
Duchamp then watched with disappointment, if not surprise, when the question of whether to exhibit the piece was put to a vote, in hypocritical violation, he believed, of the society’s widely-publicised open-mindedness
 When Fountain was rejected by fellow members on grounds of aesthetic crudity, Duchamp found his conscience suddenly cornered
 Left with no other possible move, he resigned
Doing so, however, left him with an awkward challenge: how, physically, to retrieve the scandalous sculpture without exposing himself as its impish author
 Yet somehow Duchamp succeeded in smuggling the work out of the society undetected, aided no doubt by the reliable prejudice of anyone who might have observed him, never believing that the cumbersome hunk of porcelain plumbing was an object worth protecting
 Once back in Duchamp’s possession, Fountain was whisked away to pose for Duchamp’s friend, the legendary photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whose iconic black-and-white portrait of the piece quickly etched itself into cultural consciousness
Duchamp’s reluctance to sign his own name to the work, his refusal to claim credit for it, and his strenuous efforts to avoid being seen removing the work, demonstrate a remarkable resolve to distance the maker from the made
 Such arduous anonymity is instructive in helping us establish principles for appreciating one of the most controversial works of art in the past century
The age of outrage
When it comes to contemplating Fountain, observers must rethink how an aesthetic object should be approached and put aside conventional biases about the nature of artistic craftsmanship
 For the first time, the significance of a work of art has been detached utterly from the artist's role in making it
  After all, Duchamp did not forge the sculpture from clay with his own hands
 Its significance instead lies in the object’s ability surreptitiously to skirt the scrutiny and prejudices of the eye and to engage the mind instead in a match of philosophical wits
 Sliding from eye to ‘I’, Fountain gushes with conundra about the very nature of creation and what it really means to be a maker
Since 1913, Duchamp had been experimenting with notions of originality, challenging the art world to accept as legitimate what he called ‘readymades’, or everyday commercial objects that he deemed, by situating them in a new cultural context, to be works of art
 In the case of Fountain, Duchamp purchased from the JL Mott Iron Works Company in New York a new urinal which he endeavoured to estrange from its accepted identity, just as earlier he had forced observers of his painting Nude Descending a Staircase No 2 (1912), to recalibrate the way they perceive the muscular syncopations of the female form as it flexes through space
The assumed name he attached to the object - ‘R Mutt’ - was intended, he later confessed, to being a fusion of the manufacturer’s name for the ceramic apparatus and a ‘funny’ character from the famous cartoon strip Mutt and Jeff
 Writing at the time of Fountain’s rejection from The Society of Independent Artists’ exhibition, an anonymous contributor to the Dada periodical Blind Man defended the sculpture, which had come under sustained attack, in terms that would help propel the work and the dilemmas it posed permanently into popular imagination:
"Mr Mutt’s fountain is not immoral, that is absurd, no more than a bathtub is immoral
 It is a fixture that you see every day in plumbers’ shop windows
"Whether Mr Mutt with his own hands made the fountain has no importance
 He CHOSE it
 He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view – created a new thought for that object
"
With a flick of his wrist, Duchamp had flushed traditional notions of artistic identity down the drain
 The implications for how an artist perceived his or her role in making objects would be irreversible and far-reaching
Duchamp’s Fountain became the yardstick against which outrageousness would subsequently be measured
Remove Fountain from the cluttered chessboard of modern art, and one would need to remove too a vast army of subsequent works by artists who followed Duchamp’s fearless lead
 Pop Art’s insistence on smudging the distinction between objects of high culture and the commodities of ordinary retail life directly descends from Duchamp’s notion of the readymade
 No Fountain, no Warhol Brillo Boxes
 No Campbell’s Soup Cans
 Seminally sensational, Duchamp’s Fountain became the yardstick against which outrageousness, as an aesthetic quality, would subsequently be measured
 The imagined repository for bodily waste, Fountain’s potential as a receptacle for shock is arguably filled and fulfilled 70 years later by the US artist Andres Serrano’s salacious photo of a crucifix submerged sacrilegiously in urine – a work that sparked a furore in 1987
To my eye, the open-mouth gape of Fountain’s frozen yawn prefigures, too, the guffaws of Damien Hirst’s formaldehyde shark (The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, 1991) as well as his chuckling diamond-encrusted skull, For the Love of God (2007) – all three of which chortle with menacing self-confidence in their own mesmeric power
 Yes, Fountain changed the game of art forever
 Every so-called ‘found object’ that one encounters in a contemporary art exhibition, every infuriating row of bricks we trip over in a gallery, or dishevelled bed that makes us question the relationship between concept and execution, craft and craftiness, owes its origin to Duchamp’s audacity
 With the ‘I’ of the artist now regarded as a piece that can be sacrificed without forfeiting the game, those who contemplate art have been forced to reconsider their aesthetic strategies and to practise entirely new ways of seeing
Starting in 1861, with the abolition of the death penalty for sodomy, and ending in 1967, when the act between consenting men was decriminalised in England and Wales, the new exhibition Queer British Art at Tate Britain in London offers just over a century of works exploring fluid gender identities and same-sex desire
You might expect the show to display a gradual opening up, with increasingly explicit or unabashed imagery
 Not so: the work of one of the first artists featured, Simeon Solomon – part of the Aesthetic movement and a youthful figure on the fringes of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood – potently telegraphs homosexual desire from as early as the mid-1800s
The Bride, The Bridegroom and Sad Love 
Solmon’s 1865 drawing The Bride, The Bridegroom and Sad Love – held in a private collection – is more explicit than other works intended for public display (Credit: Tate)
Witness The Bride, The Bridegroom and Sad Love, a drawing from 1865
 While the bride and bridegroom canoodle, the man’s hand reaches behind him to a winged male youth, looking sad indeed
 The groom may be turning away from same-sex love in favour of a respectable, heterosexual marriage, but the men’s fingers intertwine intimately in front of a naked crotch… As an image of forbidden, thwarted love and lust, today it seems pretty explicit
But was it so for 19th Century audiences
 In the case of this particular drawing, it probably was – it’s from a private collection – but Simeon was a notably fashionable, mainstream artist too, who exhibited at the Royal Academy, the institution at the centre of the Victorian art establishment
 Much of his public work also carried a surprisingly bold homoerotic charge
 Homosexual desire is a coded presence in many of his paintings, which in portraying classical myths, usually feature effeminate or androgynous young male nudes
Sappho and Erinna in a Garden at Mytilene 
Sappho and Erinna in a Garden at Mytilene, a watercolour from 1864, depicts the two female Greek poets in swooning embrace (Credit: Tate)
He even painted overt depictions of lesbian love, as in his watercolour Sappho and Erinna in a Garden at Mytilene, from 1864
 “It’s a really explicit depiction of female same-sex desire,” says Tate curator Clare Barlow
 “Not explicit as in pornographic, but the passionate kiss, the swooning, the flushed cheeks… it’s all there for the reading
 I think he goes further than others at the time
”
Raised eyebrows
Even if Solomon was celebrated by the Pre-Raphaelites and regularly exhibited in major galleries, critical responses were often uneasy
 Barlow points out that reactions to the highly sensuous style of the Pre-Raphaelites and the Aesthetic movement – all those languorously draped youthful bodies and heavy-lidded, languid expressions – were always shot through with contemporary anxieties
 While critics might not have been able to come out and frame or label these works as homoerotic or deviant, they nonetheless frequently got their knickers in a twist about them
As long as there was a degree of ambiguity, 19th Century society was prepared to turn a blind eye
“Words like decadent or feminine or sickly often come up – there are lots of suspicions,” says Barlow, speaking of not only Solomon but also artists like Frederic Leighton (who remained unmarried and whose sexuality was a subject of much speculation) and Edward Burne-Jones (who appears to have been primarily heterosexual)
 In 1865, the Pall Mall Gazette saw in Burne-Jones’s style “something seductive but it is not masculine”; the Spectator sniffed at a “repulsive sentiment which too frequently marks Mr Solomon’s compositions”
 Of Leighton’s Daedalus and Icarus, the Times fretted that the nude Icarus had the air of “a maiden rather than a youth”, noting anxiously the “soft rounded contour of a feminine breast” in his plump pecs
Daedalus and Icarus 
The Times’ critic fretted that the nude Icarus in Frederic Leighton’s Daedalus and Icarus had the air of “a maiden rather than a youth” (Credit: Wikipedia)
But as long as there was a degree of ambiguity – in both the work, and the artist’s proclivities – 19th Century society was prepared to turn a blind eye
 Or, at least, confine themselves to a raised eyebrow
 Even works which, to the modern viewer, look blatantly homoerotic could be respectably contained within the framework of the classical male nude, the ideal of Hellenic youthful beauty, or celebration of noble male friendship
 Such narratives “veiled the potential homoeroticism of the works,” suggests Barlow
Notes on a scandal
In 1873, however, Solomon rather publicly confirmed all whispered suspicions: he was caught having sex with a man in a public toilet off Oxford Street
 It caused a scandal, with the 32-year-old Solomon charged with “attempted buggery” and given a £100 fine; a successful career was abruptly derailed
 After once more being arrested for “indecent touching” in a lavatory in Paris the following year, he spent three months in jail
 Solomon was admitted to lunatic asylums, and would for rest of his life battle alcoholism, spending the latter part of it penniless and destitute
 It was a very public fall from grace
Simeon’s famous friends dropped him, and he died in a workhouse
“Artists at this time can get away with [suggesting] quite a lot providing there’s no hard proof,” points out Barlow
 “It’s only when Solomon gets caught that all these rumours that have been swirling about decadence and sickliness crystallise into a specific sexual act
”
Although there is a sadness to Solomon’s story – famous friends dropped him, and he died in a workhouse in Covent Garden in 1905 – the artist did continue to produce work with impressive tenacity and creative conviction
 And, later in life, he also achieved something of a cult status within gay circles
 Frederick Hollyer, the great populariser of the Pre-Raphaelites, sold photographs of his work, and collectors included Oscar Wilde, essayist and critic Walter Pater, and the writer John Addington Symonds
 “If you’re trying to seduce elegant young men in the 1890s, showing them your Simeon Solomon Hollyer editions is not likely to do you any harm,” says Barlow wryly
Queer eye
Queer British Art is a show that, necessarily, often invites us to read (or re-read) work through the frame of the artist’s life, allowing what we know – or guess – about their sexual desires to open up fresh potential meanings
  “It’s always tempting to read the biography into the work – that’s something which can be illuminating but can also be problematic
 But he does produce these incredibly agonised series of highly symbolist works at the end of his life,” says Barlow
 She refers to a series of depictions of very tortured Medusa heads, cross-gendered male
 They’re referred to as masculine in the Latin inscriptions, which say things like “it is the worst thing for the best to become corrupted” or given titles such as The Tormented Conscience
Simeon Solomon 
Solomon is shown in oriental costume in a photo by David Wilkie Wynfield, who convinced many great Victorian artists to play dress-up in front of his camera (Credit: Wikipedia)
The Tate’s exhibition may start with Solomon, but it goes right up to David Hockney and Francis Bacon, taking in cross-dressing music hall stars, Oscar Wilde’s trial, and the Bloomsbury Group’s experiments in art and living along the way
 The show aims to highlight “lots of different points of connection between the works and the queer narrative that surround them: some are autobiographical, sometimes the queerness is in the eyes of the beholder, or comes from a queer sensibility perhaps,” elaborates Barlow
“What we’re doing is seeing what happens when you put these readings front and foremost: does it add to our understanding, or are they distracting
 That’s certainly a possibility
 We’re not trying to propose that these are the only ways these works should be read, but the queer narratives often help you see things in the work you didn’t see before
”
Still, when it comes to some of Solomon’s paintings, the thing that may prove most striking to the modern viewer in how little explanation or explication they need, how readily these works from the 19th Century offer up queer readings
 And how they bring a note of tragedy in: it’s hard not to feel for Solomon, rejected from society, left out in the cold
 “Popular culture is a contradiction in terms,” remarked the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood
 “If it’s popular, it’s not culture”
 This pithy fallacy reflects a widespread belief that artistic excellence is the preserve of a social elite
 But it ignores arguably the most important creative moment in Western culture – when the citizens of ancient Athens developed a form of theatre that was richly imaginative, morally complex and distinctly democratic
Before the Athenians invented democracy, they invented tragedy, although the earliest plays that survive are from the first democratic period (507-404 BCE)
 This was a brief but brilliant era of invention, characterised by a spirit of experimentation, ambition and self-criticism
 Although the democracy was limited in scope, it catalysed extraordinary intellectual creativity, with significant innovations in mathematics, medicine, philosophy, history and poetry
Poorer citizens received a public subsidy to attend, and productions were funded by a super-tax on wealthy patrons
The Athenian experiment is notable not merely for the talents it produced: three of the greatest tragedians – Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides – and one of the finest comedians, Aristophanes
 Its achievement lies in the social imagination of the city itself, which empowered individuals to be both critical and creative
 Everyday citizens became discerning judges, whose deliberations and verdicts challenge our preconceptions about popular culture
Performances took place during a five-day religious festival called the Dionysia, named after the god of wine, associated with the loosening of tongues
 Poorer citizens received a public subsidy to attend, and productions were funded by a super-tax on wealthy patrons
 Ten citizen judges were selected randomly by lot, from a committee drawn from every corner of the city
 Of their ten votes, five were chosen at random, and tallied accordingly
 Yet the judges were careful to consider the opinions of the thousands of citizens in attendance – not least because judges could be impeached the following day
The citizens consistently rewarded productions that challenged them ideologically and excelled artistically
By the standards of modern consumer democracy, we might expect the plays to be crudely populist appeals to the lowest common denominator – simplistic, chauvinistic and jingoistic
 But the citizens consistently rewarded productions that challenged them ideologically and excelled artistically
 Prize-winning plays articulated the pleas of the un-represented – women, exiles, foreigners – and provided a rare space for the expression of unfiltered emotion
The earliest surviving tragedy, The Persians (472 BCE) by Aeschylus, illustrates this sensitivity
 Performed just eight years after the Persians had torched Athens, the play elicits sympathy for the city’s enemy (“Persian wives in softness weep / each her bold warrior husband / dispatched with gentle love and grief”)
 Athenians citizens, many of whom had suffered at the hands of the Persians, awarded the play first prize
Consumed and judged
For Professor Edith Hall of King’s College, London, The Persians is also “an exercise in self-definition; a highly subtle, clever piece of propaganda”
 Although the play is set in the court of the king Xerxes, it is more concerned with Athenian than Persian politics
 Xerxes waged a disastrous campaign against Athens that resulted in the death of many of his men, but “Persia cannot hold him / to account”
 By contrast, Athenians live in a democracy of citizens: “They are slaves to none, nor are they subject”
 The ghost of Xerxes’ father, Darius, admonishes his son’s “insolent acts and godless arrogance”
 Xerxes’ excessive ambition led him to pursue an unnecessary war; the play is a warning to those who “end up squandering great prosperity”
An anti-war message is also evident in the first surviving comedy, The Acharnians (425 BCE) by Aristophanes
 Set during the conflict with Sparta, the play critiques the most bellicose elements of Athenian society
 The protagonist, Dikaiopolis (‘the just citizen’), is a beleaguered farmer, weary after six years of war
 He magically flies over to Sparta to make his own private peace – an unlikely scenario, especially in a society that described purely private citizens as idiotes
Voting was a much more public, communal and collective political act than The X-Factor – Cartledge
The Acharnians won first prize, despite its “very tricky subject matter”, according to Professor Paul Cartledge of the University of Cambridge
 He regards Athenian theatre as “democracy in action” and describes the comedic genre as a combination of the bawdy and the satirical
 Contemporary comparisons are revealing, particularly in relation to shows that involve voting
 Cartledge says that, unlike The X Factor or Strictly Come Dancing, the performances were “a much more public, communal and collective political act
 It was quite unlike the private experience of sitting in your own home, watching a distant event on television, where you’re not face to face in conversation with your fellow judges and audience members
”
It is tempting to suggest that the playwrights achieved popularity without resorting to populism
 Theatre was regarded as education for citizenship, and Athenians were wary about appeals to base political instincts – the city even instituted a practise called ostracism, in which potentially demagogic figures were voted into exile for a decade
 Despite the presence of a chorus, the plays have no guiding narrator, and in true democratic style, present a variety of voices and arguments
The perils of popularity
Yet even at the zenith of democracy, there were prominent figures who sought to undermine it
 Plato lamented that Athenians lived under a “theatrocracy” – rule by citizens who go to the theatre
 Rather than celebrating their participation, Plato derided them as ignorant and fickle, and regretted that democracy emboldens them to exercise influence
 Theatre was an arena in which spectators became participants, and learnt to become citizens
The Savoy Theatre staged Euripides’ Medea shortly after the first mass arrest of suffragettes
The golden age did not last – after Athens’ defeat by Sparta in 404 BCE, a group of oligarchs staged a coup, dismissing democracy as a luxury
 Subsequently, theatre became a paid entertainment instead of a civic ritual, and lost its potency
There are striking similarities between the coup of the oligarchs and that of the military junta that occupied Athens 50 years ago, in 1967
 Despite proclaiming itself as nationalist, one of the junta’s first acts was to ban classical tragedies and comedies – testament to their subversive character, even 2,500 years later
 (The junta also banned Tolstoy, the Beatles and writing that suggested Socrates was homosexual)
Intriguingly, the junta did permit one play to be performed: Sophocles’ Antigone (441BCE)
 It is a mark of the sophistication of the tragedy that both the junta and its democratic opponents regarded its message as an endorsement
 For the junta, Antigone had flouted law and order for family honour, and it was the duty of Creon to punish her
 For the democrats, Creon’s self-destruction was the result of not being able to listen, and to accommodate – that most democratic of virtues
The 20th Century was characterised by the democratic re-appropriation of Greek tragedy
 In 1901, Liberal leader Henry Campbell-Bannermann denounced Britain’s concentration camps in South Africa during the Boer War, protesting the “methods of barbarism” against women and children – a direct quote from Euripides’ The Trojan Women (415 BCE)
 In 1905, the Royal Court in London staged Gilbert Murray’s translation of the play, with a strongly pro-Boer stance, and two years later the Savoy Theatre staged Murray’s translation of Euripides’ Medea (431 BCE), shortly after the first mass arrests of suffragettes
Athenian drama continues to be a fertile source of inspiration
 Professor Hall describes Tony Harrison’s 1998 film Prometheus as “the most important artistic reaction to the fall of the British working class”
 Adapted from a play often attributed to Aeschylus, the film is an imaginative interpretation of ancient myth against a backdrop of industrial decay
 For Hall, “it provides overwhelming proof that capitalism and classicism need not go hand in hand”
Tragedy can be transposed onto television, too
 The critically-acclaimed HBO series The Wire was borrowed “wholesale” from the Athenians, according to its creator David Simon, who described the series to The Believer as “Greek tragedy for the new millennium”
 The philosopher John Gray argues that The Wire distils the fundamental anti-democratic message of Greek tragedy – that chaos, rather than volition, is the dominant human condition
The theatre of democracy has a powerful global legacy, evident in the recent retelling of The Trojan Women by Syrian refugees
 The women, exiled in Jordan, interweave their experiences into Euripides’ ancient text
 But which testimonies are theirs, and which are those of the women of Troy
 Across cultures and time, from Athens to Amman, the performers are unified by their need to articulate the horrors of war
 In the words of The Phoenician Women (408 BCE), from nearby Lebanon: “It is slavery not to speak one’s thoughts
”Wizards wear them and so do dunces
 In ancient Rome, freed slaves donned them as a sign of their emancipation
 In the 15th Century, noblewomen in France and Burgundy wore them as a status symbol, as did 19th-Century women in the eastern Mediterranean, who elaborately encrusted them with pearls and precious stones
 Iron-age mummies known as the ‘Witches of Subeshi’, excavated from China’s Tarim Basin, along the northern Silk Route, were found to have fashioned them from black felt - their characteristic steep spire tapering to a peak nearly 60cm (2ft) above their heads

Despite its diverse ethnic origins, the tall pointed hat is likely, today, to elicit revulsion from those in the West who associate its distinctive shape with the sharp end of racial bigotry and the intimidating garb of the Ku Klux Klan
 But photos circulating in the media this week from Seville, Spain, serve as a reminder of the multifarious meanings of even the most seemingly singular and inimitable of cultural symbols

Captured during a parade celebrating Holy Week (which precedes Easter Sunday in the Christian calendar), the photos chronicle the procession of la Borriquita brotherhood, whose members (or ‘penitents’) hide their identities with pointy hooded hats (or ‘capirotes’) in a ritual that dates back at least as far as the Inquisition
 Historically, the capirote was intended as a mark of humiliation and was worn by those publicly punished by Church officials for doctrinal violations
 In time, the cap was adopted by Catholic brotherhoods as a voluntary guise for their flagellants (those flogging themselves as penance for their sins)
Between 1812 and 1819, the Spanish Romantic painter Francisco Goya vividly documented a more brutal rehearsal of such a procession - one in which excruciating physical penance was publicly observed by the pious participants, whose backs were whipped until bloody
 Though such harrowing displays of abuse had been banned in Spain since 1777, Goya’s A Procession of Flagellants suggests how undiminished the ritual urge remained, well into the 19th Century

But for many who encountered the photos captured in Seville this week, Goya’s portrayal may not have been the most resonant or immediate art historical echo
 Removed from their religious context, penitents wearing the capirote might easily have been mistaken instead for members of the US white-supremacist organization, the KKK, which adopted an unsettlingly similar disguise for use in its terrorising campaigns throughout the 20th Century
City Limits

Rather than recalling Goya’s gruelling canvas (which the painter hoped would call attention to aspects of society that required reform), observers of this week’s photo may have been reminded instead of an iconic image from modern Americana
 Philip Guston’s clutch of crude and cartoonish late works undertaken in the 1960s, featuring gangs of hooded Klansmen, was instrumental in helping nudge the pointy hat in the direction of farce in popular consciousness
 Placed alongside the photo of penitents from la Borriquita brotherhood, Guston’s 1969 painting City Limits with its crowded clown car of hooded cowards, offers a memorable metaphor for the endless identities with which any cultural symbol can be crammed
In the immediate aftermath of World War Two, something exciting happened in the art world in New York
 A strange but irresistible energy started to crackle across the city, as artists who had struggled for years in poverty and obscurity suddenly found self-confidence and success
 Together, they formed a movement that became known, in time, as Abstract Expressionism
 It is currently the subject of a major exhibition, featuring 164 artworks by 30 artists (including Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko), at the Royal Academy of Arts in London
One of the most remarkable things about Abstract Expressionism was the speed with which it rose to international prominence
 Although the artists associated with it took a long time to find their signature styles, once the movement had crystallised, by the late ‘40s, it rapidly achieved first notoriety and then respect
 By the ‘50s, it was generally accepted that the most exciting advances in painting and sculpture were taking place in New York rather than Paris
 In 1957, a year after Pollock’s death in a car crash, the Metropolitan Museum paid $30,000 for his Autumn Rhythm – an unprecedented sum of money for a painting by a contemporary artist at the time

The following year, The New American Painting, an influential exhibition organised by New York’s Museum of Modern Art, began a year-long tour of European cities including Basel, Berlin, Brussels, Milan, Paris, and London
 The triumph of Abstract Expressionism was complete
Unwitting helpers
Before long, though, the backlash had begun
 First came Pop Art, which wrested attention away from Abstract Expressionism at the start of the ‘60s
 Then came the rumour-mongers, whispering that the swiftness of Abstract Expressionism’s success was somehow fishy

In 1973, in an article in Artforum magazine, the art critic Max Kozloff examined post-war American painting in the context of the Cold War
 He claimed to be reacting against the “self-congratulatory mood” of recent publications such as Irving Sandler’s The Triumph of American Painting (1970), the first history of Abstract Expressionism
 Kozloff went on to argue that Abstract Expressionism was “a form of benevolent propaganda”, in sync with the post-war political ideology of the American government
Pollock said that everyone at his high school thought he was a ‘rotten rebel from Russia’
In many ways, the idea seemed preposterous
 After all, most of the Abstract Expressionists were volatile outsiders
 Pollock once said that everyone at his high school in Los Angeles thought he was a “rotten rebel from Russia”
 According to David Anfam, co-curator of the Royal Academy exhibition, “Rothko said he was an anarchist
 Barnett Newman was a declared anarchist – he wrote an introduction to Kropotkin’s book on anarchism
 So here you had this nexus of non-conformist artists, who were completely alienated from American culture
 They were the opposite of the Cold Warriors
”
Despite this, however, Kozloff’s ideas took hold
 A few years before they were published, in 1967, the New York Times had revealed that the liberal anti-Communist magazine Encounter had been indirectly funded by the CIA
 As a result, people started to become suspicious
 Could it be that the CIA also had a hand in promoting Abstract Expressionism on the world stage
 Was Pollock, wittingly or not, a propagandist for the US government
Soft power
A number of essays, articles and books followed Kozloff’s piece, all arguing that the CIA had somehow manipulated Abstract Expressionism
 In 1999, the British journalist and historian Frances Stonor Saunders published a book about the CIA and the “cultural Cold War” in which she asserted: “Abstract Expressionism was being deployed as a Cold War weapon
” A synthesis of her argument is available online, in an article that she wrote for the Independent newspaper in 1995
 “In the manner of a Renaissance prince – except that it acted secretly – the CIA fostered and promoted American Abstract Expressionist painting around the world for more than 20 years,” she wrote

The gist of her case goes something like this
 We know that the CIA bankrolled cultural initiatives as part of its propaganda war against the Soviet Union
 It did so indirectly, on what was called a “long leash”, via organisations such as the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), an anti-Communist advocacy group active in 35 countries, which the CIA helped to establish and fund
 It was the CCF that sponsored the launch of Encounter magazine in 1953, for instance
 It also paid for the Boston Symphony Orchestra to travel to Paris to participate in a festival of modern music
It is possible that important British abstract painters were shaped by America’s spymasters
According to Saunders, the CCF financed several high-profile exhibitions of Abstract Expressionism during the ‘50s, including The New American Painting, which toured Europe between 1958 and 1959
 Supposedly, the Tate Gallery couldn’t afford to bring the exhibition to London – so an American millionaire called Julius Fleischmann stepped in, stumping up the cash so that it could travel to Britain
 Fleischmann was the president of a body called the Farfield Foundation, which was funded by the CIA
 It is therefore possible to argue that important British abstract painters, such as John Hoyland, who were profoundly influenced by the Tate’s exhibition in ’59, were shaped by America’s spymasters

Saunders also highlighted links between the CIA and New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), which was instrumental in promoting Abstract Expressionism
 Nelson Rockefeller, the president of MoMA during the ‘40s and ‘50s, had close ties with the US intelligence community
 So did Thomas Braden, who directed cultural activities at the CIA: prior to joining “the Company”, he was MoMA’s executive secretary
‘Shrewd and cynical’
Even today, however, the story of the CIA’s involvement with Abstract Expressionism remains contentious
 According to Irving Sandler, who is now 91, it is totally untrue
 Speaking to me by phone from his apartment in New York’s Greenwich Village, he said: “There was absolutely no involvement of any government agency
 I haven’t seen a single fact that indicates there was this kind of collusion
 Surely, by now, something – anything – would have emerged
 And isn’t it interesting that the federal government at the time considered Abstract Expressionism a Communist plot to undermine American society
” 
America was the land of the free, whereas Russia was locked up, culturally speaking – David Anfam
David Anfam is more circumspect
 He says it is “a well-documented fact” that the CIA co-opted Abstract Expressionism in their propaganda war against Russia
 “Even The New American Painting [exhibition] had some CIA funding behind it,” he says
 According to Anfam, it is easy to see why the CIA wished to promote Abstract Expressionism
 “It’s a very shrewd and cynical strategy,” he explains, “because it showed that you could do whatever you liked in America
” By the ‘50s, Abstract Expressionism was bound up with the concept of individual freedom: its canvases were understood as expressions of the subjective inner lives of the artists who painted them
Franz Klein

As a result, the movement was a useful foil to Russia’s official Soviet Realist style, which championed representative painting
 “America was the land of the free, whereas Russia was locked up, culturally speaking,” Anfam says, characterising the perception that the CIA wished to foster during the Cold War
This isn’t to say, of course, that the artists themselves were complicit with the CIA, or even aware that it was funding Abstract Expressionist exhibitions
 Still, whatever the truth of the extent of the CIA’s financial involvement with Abstract Expressionism, Anfam believes that it was “the best thing the institution ever paid for”
 He smiles
 “I’d much rather they spent money on Abstract Expressionism than toppling left-wing dictators
”One of the key locations of Game of Thrones is the wall at the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms
 Three hundred miles long, seven hundred feet high, and built of ice blocks, it is here that the Night Watch hold the line against the ‘wildings’ that lie beyond and whisper rumours of the undead White Walkers
 The viewers know by now that these super-zombies exist, that the wall has been breached, and “winter is coming”
Game of Thrones’ wall evokes Hadrian’s Wall, which separated the Romans from the Barbarians
In George RR Martin’s novels, the historical inspiration is Hadrian’s Wall in northern England
 It marked the northern limit of the Roman Empire, dividing conquered land from the unbeaten northern tribes
 Although a more modest affair, stretching 70 miles (113km) and rarely standing more than 10ft (3m) high, it was built in about six years from 122 CE
 Manned with castles at every Roman mile, Hadrian’s Wall was a mark of imperial power and was intended, as one early chronicle records, ‘to separate the Romans from the Barbarians
’
This has long been the function of walls
 Announced as defensive structures and imagined as vast impenetrable barriers, instead they are often gestural markers that serve more social, psychological and symbolic purposes
 They help a culture to define itself by keeping what it’s not at bay
(Credit: HBO)

The wall in Game of Thrones might be a fantastical barrier, but this – so far – is the status of that other wall that dominates contemporary debate: Trump’s pledge in the election campaign in 2016 “to build a wall and get Mexico to pay for it”
 Although some suggested designs for Trump’s boundary wall have been released, it is still unclear how this vast infrastructural project will be funded and managed
 Its purpose, so far, has been entirely about symbolic conceptions of nation and belonging
(Credit: Alamy)

Trump’s wall has, of course, many historical precedents
 The Great Wall of China was started as early as 481 BCE, although the iconic stone sections date from about 400 years ago
 This wall, too, was used to mark the civilised world from the impure tribes beyond
 At over 4000 miles long, sparsely garrisoned and sometimes little more than raised earthworks, it was not much use as a physical barrier or defensive structure, but operated more as a symbol that defined Chinese nationhood, which was premised for centuries on ethnic and cultural exclusion
 This is why the Communist Party since 1949 has continued to add to the wall and preserve its historical sections as an emblem of the nation: it defines the People of the People’s Republic
The Greeks called those beyond the city walls barbarians
The Greeks had similar motivations
 They called those beyond the city walls barbarians– the word mocking the “bar-bar” stutter of those barely civilised enough to speak
 Greek horror deepened the further they went from home
 Beyond the known world of the Mediterranean sea were the Anthropophagi, the cannibal men who were little more than beasts hungry for human flesh
 This horror still haunts contemporary Gothic fiction: beyond the walls or fences of every final refuge after the apocalypse, zombies mass in indifferent, devouring hordes
 On The Walking Dead, the stripping away of all civilisation beyond the walls applies forcefully to human survivors who are nevertheless still strangers, not of the group
 Walls have always offered a way of dividing the human from the inhuman
Divide and conquer
The Cold War era was haunted by the building of the Berlin Wall by East Germany, which was started in August 1961
 It was designed to prevent the mass migration of Eastern bloc citizens to the West, the structure being continually reinforced and rebuilt for three decades
 Hundreds were killed trying to cross the 96 miles of wall that enclosed West Berlin, and the border zone became the iconic setting for many spy thrillers, from John Le Carré’s The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965) to Steven Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies (2015)
 The Berlin Wall wasn’t just geo-political, but served as a handy psychological emblem of alienation and self-division, as in Pink Floyd’s concept album The Wall (1979)
(Credit: Roadside Attractions)
Doug Liman’s new film The Wall is about two US soldiers who take cover behind a wall when pinned down by a sniper in Iraq (Credit: Roadside Attractions)
However, the Berlin Wall appeared at the beginning of inter-continental missiles, mass air travel and global satellite communications, and these made the wall seem increasingly absurd in a seemingly ‘borderless’ world
 It became a disastrous symbol of the coercion and control of East Germany over its citizens
 Many US presidents used the wall as a backdrop for ideological statements of Western freedom, from John F Kennedy onwards
 When Ronald Reagan spoke in Berlin in 1987, his injunction to “tear down this wall” was a crucial moment in ending the Cold War
 Two years later, in November 1989, the borders were declared open and Berliners themselves began dismantling a wall that had divided the city for 28 years
The new millennium has been marked by an extraordinary number of wall-building projects
For a while, in the 1990s, we believed in the rhetoric of a frictionless globalised world, the free movement of money, goods and people
 This was what the sociologist Manuel Castells celebrated as “the space of flows”
 Yet the new millennium has been marked by an extraordinary number of wall-building projects around the world, in direct response to anxieties produced by open borders
 The rhetoric of internationalism and free movement across borders has become very hemmed in by the simultaneous construction of physical barriers that often serve deeply symbolic ends

Israel began its ‘separation barrier’ in 2000 – the government agencies that proposed and are building it tend to avoid using the word ‘wall’
 It was a response to the violent uprising of Palestinians on the West Bank, the Second Intifada, and the barrier was meant to separate the Palestinian population from territory assigned to Israel
 It is projected to be 440 miles (708km) long when complete, although the building has been continually challenged in international law
 Simone Bitton’s documentary Wall (2004) ends with the everyday passage of people climbing up and over the wall, a silent evocation of how porous the barrier remains
 Rather more apocalyptically, World War Z (2013) at first seems to regard the Israeli separation barrier and militarized check-points as robust defences against a zombie virus outbreak, but of course the wall is overrun by undead hordes – just as it is in Game of Thrones
Concrete canvas
Of course, just as walls serve as barriers they become blank canvases, as well
 The graffiti on the Berlin and the West Bank walls has become famous for the expression of resistance to separation
 One of the most popular artists of our time, Banksy, has made a career out of stencilling art defiantly on walls

Meanwhile, in 2004, India finally completed their electrified fence along the Line of Control through disputed territory separating India and Pakistan
 It is over 340 miles long
 The refugee crisis since the collapse of Libya and Syria into civil wars has prompted a whole rash of wall-building to defend European borders, from the Spanish fence around the port of Melilla in Morocco to the various border fences built by the Hungarian government in 2015 and 2016
 Nationalist reactions to ‘borderless Europe’ have been a mark of recent elections across the continent
 For all the walls, millions of refugees have still made it through the perilous journey
As for the history behind Trump’s Wall, the border between the US and Mexico was first formally established in a treaty of 1848, and initially marked only by piles of stones and a handful of marble obelisks
 The first fencing went up in 1945 to manage the large numbers moving across the border at Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez
 The building of a physical border was massively extended following the founding of the Department of Homeland Security and its ‘Secure Border Initiative’ of 2005
 Since then, over 650 miles of fencing have been constructed, under both Republican and Democratic presidencies
 For all the rhetoric of invasion, deportations have exceeded inward migrants since 2005

The cultural representation of this southern border has matched this ratcheted anxiety
 In the 1940s, Anthony Mann’s liberal Hollywood film Border Incident (1949) imagined benign co-operation between Mexico and the US as the ideal to protect vulnerable Mexicans tempted by people smugglers
 In Orson Welles’ noir, Touch of Evil(1958), the film famously opens with an exuberant crane shot that travels across the US/Mexico border in a single, unbroken take
 Now, in films like Sicario (2015) or TV series like Breaking Bad (2008-13), the border zone is highly militarised, and the place south of the border is imagined as a demonic world of violence, degradation and terror, where unimaginable torture and cruel death awaits the foolhardy American
Walls retain their psychological value as demarcations of a dream of purity
In Gareth Edwards’ horror film, Monsters (2010), the border becomes a gigantic wall, hundreds of feet high, trying to fence off America from the vast alien creatures that now roam the land
 Of course this defence fails, and the film ends with the American south ‘infected’ by what seem gracious, sublime yet utterly alien beings strolling through an extended borderscape of abandoned towns
All of which is to say that the mythical power of White Walkers coming from beyond to bring pestilence and death to the civilised Seven Kingdoms in Game of Thrones is hardly out of keeping with our contemporary wall-building frenzy
Of course, walls remain practically rather useless barriers, rendered increasingly obsolete by new technologies like drones
 Yet they clearly retain their psychological value as demarcations of a dream of purity, keeping out all those threats to self-identity
 Let’s just hope that with Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead and other stories formerly deemed fantastical that now look allegorical we can satisfy our violent fantasies of expulsion and purification through fiction rather than real life
“It’s a fairly gruesome process that would’ve involved removal of the brain through the nose
 They would then have removed the internal organs - the viscera,” says John J Johnson of the Egypt Exploration Society, describing the intricate process of ancient Egyptian mummification
 "The body would then be washed and covered in oils
”
The curse of Tutankhamun supposedly resulted in real deaths
Ninety-five years have passed since the excavation of the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun and the event continues to provoke mythological fascination
 It fueled film-makers’ imaginations, manifesting in a malevolent, bandaged brute that enacted murderous revenge in retaliation for cultural desecration and forbidden love
A largely cinematic fabrication, the reanimated mummy was inspired by the alleged Curse of Tutankhamun
 According to newspaper reports in the early 1920s it resulted in early deaths of several people connected to British archaeologist Howard Carter’s 1922 Valley of the Kings expedition, including its wealthy financial backer Lord Carnarvon, who died of an infected mosquito bite the same year

The idea of Egyptian mummies as a fearful threat to haunt one’s nightmares mostly comes from the movies, such as Karl Freund’s The Mummy starring Boris Karloff (Credit: Universal)
Sharing similarities to other semi-tragic undead screen monstrosities like Dracula and Frankenstein’s monster, the mournful threat of the mummy is arguably more deeply engrained in our collective consciousness due to the real unearthing of Tutankhamun, rather than the literary antecedents of the other characters
Following the media frenzy around the excavation, a particular idea of Egypt took hold in the popular imagination and fed into the development of the architectural style, Art Deco
 American movie houses of the 1920s were typically adorned with extravagant Egyptian décor that mimicked the imagined opulence of the ancient culture
 Capitalising on this eruption of Egyptomania, Universal Studios unleashed The Mummy on cinemagoers in 1932

Boris Karloff famously played the mummified high priest Imhotep, who is inadvertently brought back to life by the reading of a magical scroll
 Posing as a modern Egyptian, Imhotep becomes convinced his lost love Ankh-es-en-amon, (named after Ankhesenamun, the half-sister and wife of King Tut) has been reincarnated as a woman who bears a striking likeness to his deceased princess
 It was escapist entertainment for audiences living through the Great Depression

Lending the project an element of legitimacy, the film’s screenwriter John L Balderston had been a news correspondent who had reported on the opening of King Tut’s tomb

It took another eight years before the next mummy film from Universal surfaced
 The Mummy’s Hand (1940) was the first in a reimagined but decidedly dumbed-down franchise
 Despite popular belief, Karloff actually only appears as the titular bandaged being during the memorably unnerving 10-minute opening of the original film: it was only in the follow-ups that the revived creature became the lumbering threat we know today
 The idea of a mobile mummy would have been totally alien to the ancient Egyptians and goes against the entire concept of mummification, sought to preserve the dead for a still and peaceful afterlife
Unwrapping a legend
Hammer Studios brought the mummy back to fearsome life with Terence Fisher’s The Mummy in 1959, a film that honoured the original legend and recognised the creature’s romantic appeal by reinstating an Ankhesenamun figure named Princess Ananka, (Yvonne Furneaux)
 Screenwriter Jimmy Sangster borrowed from Universal’s uneven sequels and adopted the moniker Kharis for the towering creature (Christopher Lee) having mistakenly presumed it was the name of a real Egyptian god

A deadly curse also plagues a team of archaeologists in Hammer’s subsequent outing, The Mummy’s Shroud (1967): they are murdered one-by-one by their reanimated discovery

A beautiful but deadly Egyptian queen and her modern reincarnation (both played by Valerie Leon) replace the conventional mummy in Blood From The Mummy’s Tomb (1971), an adaptation of Bram Stoker’s 1903 novel The Jewel of the Seven Stars
 This film appeared to be plagued by a curse of its own
 Five weeks into production, director Seth Holt suddenly died from a heart attack
 Furthermore Peter Cushing was cast as Leon’s father but was shortly replaced after the unexpected death of his beloved wife

Having clearly exhausted the material, (and after possibly aggravated the pharaohs enough) there wouldn’t be another mainstream mummy film until the turn of the century
 However, in the interim, some fantasy adventure films drew on Egyptian culture, mummification and the excavation of ancient artefacts

Spielberg’s first Indiana Jones adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) hinged on the search for the Ark of the Covenant in Egypt
 The film-maker also notably produced Young Sherlock Holmes (1985), which centred on the budding sleuth uncovering an underground Egyptian cult who mummify live human sacrifices as part of their sadistic ritual
 Roland Emmerich’s Stargate (1994) concerned the gateway to a distant planet that mirrored ancient Egypt and played upon its exotic lure and despotic history with an alien masquerading as the Egyptian god Ra
Mummy mutation 
The dawn of the 21st Century ushered in a whole new mummy franchise (1999-2008) that starred Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz and reverted back to the legend of Imhotep
“Most of this movie is based on real myths and real legends even though it’s a story about a 3,000-year-old walking, talking corpse,” claimed director Stephen Sommers of the first campy film in the series
 The story hinges on the unintentionally awakened shape shifting creature that summons the ‘ten plagues of Egypt’
 While audiences felt pity for Karloff’s mummy, in this remake he was a fully-fledged antagonist, totally devoid of sympathy
 It didn’t make a difference to the box office and two further adventures were exhumed
Judging from the trailer to the Tom Cruise-powered franchise-building Mummy revamp, it looks likely the retribution this time will erupt from an accidentally discovered mummified ancient sorceress (Sofia Boutella) who murdered her father
 Even if this film disappoints, the mummy certainly won’t be done lumbering toward cinema screens anytime soon
When Girls began in 2012 I watched with interest
 I’m always fascinated by young women writers when they push boundaries
 Intrigued to see that the first season showed four young women in their 20s trying to survive in darkest Brooklyn, I was riveted by the first crisis: Hannah’s parents cutting her off financially
 What a great idea for an opening
I grew depressed by the characters’ sex lives – how could we have gone so backward
But as the series progressed, I grew depressed by the sexual situation of the protagonists
 The girls who had boyfriends seemed never to reach orgasm with them
 The guys were ignorant about women’s pleasure
 They were a bunch of boobs who only thought of their own satisfaction
 It was funny but also terribly sad
 How could we have gone so backward
 I didn’t want to focus on the advances of my era coming undone, but I would watch the show from time to time because I admired its honesty

However, when I was asked to write about the latest iterations of Hannah and her ‘sisters’, I began to watch the new season more consistently and found myself interested again
 In one recent episode, Hannah confronts a male chauvinist novelist about whom she has negatively blogged
 He tries to seduce her
 She resists
 At first we think she’ll discover that he is really a good guy, but by the end of the episode we know that he has tried this trick on many other women
 His penis suddenly slides out of his pants and we recognise that he’s a player with an old piano
 The writing is true and funny
 In another episode, Hannah is pregnant and has to deal with wanting the baby but not being sure she wants the man

Girls has been a ‘think piece’ magnet, with much criticism lobbed at Dunham and her character Hannah – but there's a long history of people judging female characters (Credit: HBO)
Inevitably, I wondered whether my now 38-year-old daughter had any experiences that echoed these
 She did not
  Or maybe she never told me
 After all, what does a mother really know
 But my own experience was so different from the fictional Hannah’s
 In high school and college, my boyfriends generally adored me and my writing
 They also cared about my pleasure
 I wouldn’t have had it any other way
  It was only after my divorce from my daughter’s father when I was 39 that I encountered a bumpy parade of awful men
 I don’t know if this was because I was by then a ‘celebrity’ – whatever that means –  and some of the men who came on to me thought I was rich, or perhaps the world had simply changed yet again
 It seemed to me that every time I was single between marriages there were new dating protocols
 When I graduated from my marriage to my daughter’s father, it seemed everyone expected to go to bed on the first date
 Every few years, the sexual rules seemed to change
 Very confusing
 Neither my nor my daughters’ experience was like the experiences of the girls on Girls
 Still, I can relate which must mean the writing works
Breaking the mould
Lena Dunham has had the guts to go on camera without makeup, without hairdressing, and often without clothes
 There’s been plenty of controversy about that
 But I see her as courageous
 Women are so imprisoned by the need to be beautiful and thin and compete with skeletal models in magazines, that it takes enormous moxie to flout these imperatives
(Credit: AMC)

I believe that writing, whether satirical or heart-stoppingly tender, must be honest – or why bother
 I’ve never liked romance novels nor superhero comics nor car-chase movies because they bore me
 They’re entertainment of a sort, but they don’t interest me
 I want truth
 Without truth, I’m not interested
 Girls has moments of truth
 Not every episode is equally well-written nor equally moving but some are excellent
Does anybody ever find a male hero ‘unlikeable’
And I feel empathy for the way Lena Dunham has been treated as a writer and actor
 Her series has been criticised for not being ethnically diverse
 She has been mocked for her nudity and plumpness
 She’s been snickered at for sexuality while at the same time being criticised for not being naked enough
 Her heroines have been seen as ‘unlikeable’ – does anybody ever find a male hero ‘unlikeable’
 Never
 Whether it’s Tony Soprano or Philip Roth’s Zuckerman, or even James Bond, male protagonists are never subjected to such criticism
 But when it comes to women – every critic feels that he or she has the right to complain
 I once read a 19th Century review in which a cranky male critic said of Jane Eyre, “I would never hire her as a governess
” This may seem funny to you – it’s certainly absurd, but it happens all the time to women who write
 I’ve often wondered how we can change this
 In the US, Hillary Clinton was pilloried for being ‘unlikeable’ so we got Donald Trump who, not even three months into his presidency, has historically low approval ratings – yet was he somehow more ‘likable’
I had dared to be naked about sex in a puritanical country and nobody let me forget it
Girls asks many questions worth asking
 The show is not scared to push boundaries and display the ugly truth – that life is not glossy like magazine covers
 Women are not all long-legged and big-boobed
 Not all men will do it for you
 It’s not easy to make money doing what you love
 Being an adult is a challenge, and sometimes life sucks
 The show celebrates and accentuates the things young women deal with and it does so without pushing aside common female experiences
Scarlet letters
Lena Dunham’s history as a writer echoes my own
 In 1973, when I published Fear of Flying, I was battered by both male and female critics
 Some of them seemed to regard me as the ‘happy hooker’ of literature
 The fact that I’d been a prize-winning younger poet who had won many of the same awards as Sylvia Plath and WS Merwin didn’t seem to make much of a difference
 I had dared to be naked about sex in a puritanical country and nobody let me forget it
 I was a slut, a tart, a loose woman – not a writer
 To this day the tainting continues here in the US
 I have always been more honoured abroad

On Girls, Allison Williams’ Marnie has been a target of even more frequent hate than Dunham’s Hannah – Marnie is seen as a symbol of cluelessness (Credit: HBO)
Forty-four years later, that first novel has been published all over the world in more than 40 languages
 It has sold over 35 million copies
 People now tell me I’m an “icon” – whatever that means
 It’s utterly astounding to me that the criticisms I faced all those years ago are still current

The world is full of wonderful women writers
 From Sappho to Emily Dickinson to Charlotte Brontë and her sisters, we have always written and written well
 We have produced Middlemarch, Jane Eyre, Beloved, White Teeth, The Country Girls, Possession –  too many to name here
 But while Philip Roth waits for his Nobel, we are poised for the next attack
 No wonder young women get writer’s block and decide to stop writing and get pregnant instead
So, mazel tov to the writers and producers of Girls
 They have done something important
  Don’t worry – they’ll be punished for it
 That’s the way it goes
Difficult as it may be to remember, there was a time when Western politics seemed fairly stable and predictable
 That was certainly the premise of Veep, the Emmy-winning White House sitcom which has just returned to HBO for a sixth series
 “When the show started it was very much satirising the stasis of Washington,” says Will Smith - not the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, but one of the writers of Veep
 “It was about the feeling that nothing really changes, and that bureaucracy keeps grinding on
”
Then came 2016
 Triggered by a series of populist votes, an earthquake rearranged the political landscape in the US and Europe
 The United Kingdom chose to leave the European Union
 The United States chose to elect Donald Trump
 Whether you think this shake-up was long overdue, or whether you’re stocking up on canned goods and digging a fall-out shelter in your back garden, there is no doubt that our leaders and their decisions are, shall we say, less conventional and more colourful than they once were
 And this raises the issue of whether any comedy set in the political realm can possibly be as ludicrous, hilarious, exciting and terrifying as what we see on the news every day
 Is reality officially beyond satire
It’s hard to parody people who are already a parody of themselves – Jonathan Lynn
“It’s a problem,” says Jonathan Lynn
 “There’s no question about that
” In the US, Lynn is best known as the director of My Cousin Vinny and The Whole Nine Yards
 But in Britain he is revered for co-writing the country’s most elegant political sitcom, Yes Minister, in the 1980s
 He believes that that was a very different era
 “Our politicians in Britain and America have been behaving in a bizarre fashion for several months
 And it’s hard to parody people who are already a parody of themselves
”
“There’s been nothing like this before,” agrees David Quantick, a former writer of Veep and its British precursor, The Thick of It
 “Veep was always set in a parallel world, but that parallel world was vaguely similar to what was going on
 Now, though, America has been taken over by a deranged monarchy
 They’re people who aren’t politicians in the old sense
 They’re billionaires and people from Breitbart News
 They’re aliens
” 
So what’s a satirist to do
 Trey Parker, the co-creator of South Park, has admitted defeat
 “In the last season, we were really trying to make fun of what was going on, but we couldn’t keep up,” he told Australia’s ABC News
 “What was actually happening was much funnier than anything we could come up with, so we decided to back off and let [politicians] do their comedy and we’ll do ours
” Armando Iannucci, the mastermind behind The Thick of It and Veep, made a similar admission to CNN in September
 “When the politicians are providing us with the fiction, there’s no place for people like me
”
Stranger than fiction
The challenge faced by political screenwriters has three facets
 The first is that the real-life characters are suddenly so weird and wonderful
 Andrea Leadsom, a British MP who stood for the leadership of the Conservative Party last year, “would have been too broad as a character in a sitcom,” says Smith
 “You’d think, I just don’t believe that person would ever have the nerve to put herself forward as prime minister
 It’s the same with Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg
 If we’d had any of them in The Thick of It, it would have been too much
”
The sea change is that politicians are no longer even trying to be tactful, says Matt Forde, the host of a topical British comedy show, Unspun
 “Traditionally, comedy about politics came from characters saying things without saying them, saying yes while meaning no, being offensive while being polite
 But with Trump, all nuance is gone
 When you’re doing impressions of politicians, you can get a lot of mileage out of saying outrageous things that they would never say
 But there’s nothing that Trump wouldn’t say
”
For Lynn, the most significant shift is politicians’ willingness to spout ‘alternate facts’
 “Politicians have never been notable for telling the truth,” he says, “but what’s happening now is just flagrant lying with no shame about it
 Whether it’s because politicians are delusional, which might be true of the Brexit people, or completely paranoid, which is true of Trump, it’s truly Orwellian
 It’s Newspeak, right out of Nineteen Eighty-Four
”
The residents of the Big Brother house are more discreet than the residents of the White House
The second facet is that there are so few secrets left in politics for satirists to uncover
 In the 1980s, Yes Minister revealed what went on behind the scenes in British government
 “We had lots of sources,” says Lynn, “who told us things that were not widely known
” In the 2000s, The Thick of It took on that mantle
 “It was about the spin and what was behind the spin,” says Smith
 “But now so much of politics is played out in public that spin doesn’t exist in the same way
” Thanks to social media, we live in a world where senators blurt out every passing thought on Twitter and where policies are leaked while they’re still being drafted
  The residents of the Big Brother house are more discreet than the residents of the White House
The third facet is that current affairs are hurtling along at such a breakneck speed that screenplays go out of date before the printer ink is dry
 “Reality is so mad and so fast-moving that nobody knows what’s going to happen, so I just can’t see how you could do any kind of commentary on it,” says Smith
 “You could write a sitcom about Trump now, and by the time it got on air, he might have done anything between going to prison and starting a war
”
‘A thrilling period’
Lynn and his co-writer, the late Antony Jay, never worried about that when they were making Yes Minister
 “We used to write the whole series months ahead of the recording,” says Lynn, “but then we would often put in one topical joke or reference at the last minute, and that had the effect of making the audience think that the whole thing was topical
” At the moment, Lynn is scripting a play about Brexit, but is finding it to be a “moving target”
 “Every week I write a scene,” he says, “and then the following week I have to rewrite it because something’s happened
 If the play is ever finished and ever produced, it will need actors who are flexible enough to make changes on a weekly basis
”
One solution for satirists, says Lynn, is to draw themes and characters from life, but to put them in a different setting
 The anti-hero of his new novel, Samaritans, is based on Trump, but he works in a hospital rather than on a golf course or in the Oval Office
 Likewise, Howard Jacobson, winner of the Man Booker prize, has reimagined recent developments in the US as a fairy-tale novel called Pussy, in which the President is transformed into Prince Fracassus
And coincidentally, the writers of Veep were fortunate enough to turf their sitcom’s heroine, Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), out of the White House and into the political wilderness at the end of the last series
 “If Selina was still in office,” says Smith, “it would be very difficult for the show because it wouldn’t be reflecting reality of all
” The West Wing suffered in later series, Smith notes, when its Democratic president was so obviously unlike George W Bush, the Republican who had just been elected
 “It just seemed to exist in a fantasy-land after that
”
At any rate, the loopiness of today’s politics is only a headache for a writer who is sweating over a sitcom, a film, or some other project that takes months to come to fruition
 For satirists who can respond instantly to the news, it’s a boon
 Daily and weekly shows now have so much material that Stephen Colbert’s political jokes on The Late Show have made it the most popular late-night show in America, while the impersonations of Trump and Sean Spicer on Saturday Night Live have brought the programme its highest ratings in over 20 years
 “It’s a very thrilling period,” says Forde, “in a quite macabre way
” 
The newly mind-boggling nature of politics hasn’t been all bad for the writers of Veep, either
 “The Jonah Ryan character [played by Timothy Simons] is such an awful, unpleasant, bigoted person,” says Smith, “that there have been moments in the past where audiences might have thought, ‘how come his colleagues haven’t got rid of him
’ But Trump’s rise has allowed us to have Jonah succeed in spite of himself
 So that’s one good thing about Trump
 He’s let us make Jonah more extreme

Nightmares in waxA tiny foetus, its foot kicking out of a womb; an intestine piled up next to a lifeless figure, her torso ripped open from the string of pearls on her neck to her abdomen
 Our natural reaction is to recoil with disgust, to dismiss these eerie waxworks as freak show objects
 Yet to do so is to misunderstand them, says the author of a new book
 “They do say something different to us today from what they meant at the time,” says Joanna Ebenstein, co-founder of the Morbid Anatomy Museum in New York
 Her book The Anatomical Venus reveals how a figure that provokes an uneasy reaction in viewers now was once a popular tool for instruction
 This Anatomical Venus, produced by the workshop at La Specola in Florence between 1784 and 1788, is displayed in her original rosewood and Venetian glass case at the Josephinum, Vienna, Austria

Skin deepCreated between 1780 and 1782, the original anatomical Venus by Clemente Susini (pictured) can still be seen at La Specola – the public science museum founded by Leopold II in Florence
 Also known as ‘the Medici Venus’, the life-size wax figure has real human hair, and can be dissected into seven anatomically correct layers
 She spawned numerous copies, referred to as Slashed Beauties or Dissected Graces and also displayed in medical museums
 “Supine in their glass boxes, they beckon with a gentle smile or an ecstatic downcast gaze,” writes Ebenstein in The Anatomical Venus
 “One idly toys with a plait of real golden human hair; another clutches at the plush, moth-eaten satin cushions of her case as her torso erupts in a spontaneous, bloodless auto-dissection; another is crowned with a golden tiara, while one further wears a silk ribbon tied in a bow around a dangling entrail

Fairground attractionIt’s a world away from Madame Tussauds
 No grinning faces to be photographed in selfies; no celebrity glamour or statesmanlike poses
 These are waxworks that both intrigue and repulse: models that seem to hover somewhere between freak show and operating theatre
 Ebenstein aims to place them in their cultural context, looking at the history of the anatomical Venus and finding out where it fits in the 21st Century
 “Since their creation in late-18th-Century Florence, these wax women have seduced, intrigued, and instructed
 In the 21st Century, they also confound, flickering on the edges of medicine and myth, votive and vernacular, fetish and fine art,” she writes in her opening chapter
 “How can we understand today an object that is at once a seductive representation of ideal female beauty and an explicit demonstration of the inner workings of the body
 How can we make sense of an artefact that was once equally at home in the fairground and the medical museum

Cultural curiosity (Credit: Credit: Josephinum, Collections and History of Medicine, MedUni Vienna/Photo Joanna Ebenstein)
Cultural curiosityEbenstein had to wrestle with her own feelings when she first encountered the Venus
 “It’s so confusing, and it has such power when you see it, it’s hard not to be drawn in,” she tells BBC Culture
 “I was trying to figure out how to make sense of it – it looks so bizarre to us now
 Of all the forms an anatomical teaching tool could take, how come it was that one
” She overcame her initial reaction by reading about the Venus and looking at figures in different settings
 “I went to other kinds of museums and churches to try and understand the context of the culture that created it, which made me start thinking about it in a very different way from most people in the medical museum world,” she says
 “My background is intellectual history, so when I look at an object that looks strange to us today, my first thought is ‘Why
 Did it look strange to people at the time
 What does it say about us that it now looks strange
’” (Credit: Josephinum, Collections and History of Medicine, MedUni Vienna/Photo Joanna Ebenstein)

Venus in pearlsEbenstein realised that the Venus was not an oddity: it was truly a product of its time
 Leopold II founded La Specola after becoming the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1765; he aimed to educate Florentines in the empirical observation of natural laws and challenge the more irrational practices of the Roman Catholic church
 His new museum, Ebenstein argues, “would make available to the general public the rare and valuable cultural artefacts previously secreted in the Medici Wunderkammern, or cabinets of wonder”
 In a period when the study of the natural world included what we know today as science, aesthetics and metaphysics, she claims, “the Medici Venus was a perfect embodiment of the Enlightenment values of her time, in which human anatomy was understood as a reflection of the world and the pinnacle of divine knowledge, and in which to know the human body was to know the mind of God

Dissecting beauty (Credit: Credit: Josephinum, Collections and History of Medicine, MedUni Vienna/Photo Joanna Ebenstein)
Dissecting beautyIn a bid to depict humans in a more realistic way, visual artists of the Renaissance carried out their own dissections – more even than anatomists of the era
 According to Ebenstein, Leonardo da Vinci “is said to have dissected more than 100 bodies, and famously ‘sketched cadavers he had dissected with his own hand’”
 One key anatomical text of 1543, De Humani Corporis Fabrica (On the Fabric of the Human Body), was illustrated with woodcuts “thought to be by Titian’s studio in Venice”
 That overlap of disciplines was the background for the anatomical Venus
 “One of the things that makes the Venus so hard for us to understand is that we’ve now divided up all those things in ways that wasn’t divided in the time that it was made,” Ebenstein tells BBC Culture
 “We have this division between art and science, and between religion and medicine, that didn’t exist at that time

One foot in the grave (Credit: Credit: Wellcome Library, London)
One foot in the graveThe creators of the ‘Slashed Beauties’ aimed to bring anatomy out of the graveyard
 “Most of anatomical knowledge was derived from dead bodies, and that’s not appropriate for a popular audience,” says Ebenstein
 “So how do you create an object that can take something from the grave and the cadavers it took to make it, but make people forget that, or not know it, and make them seduced by it
 A lot of her beauty has to do with that, it’s essential to making her a popular object
” There is a quote in the book from the 18th Century anatomical illustrator Arnaud-Éloi Gautier D’Agoty: “For men to be instructed, they must be seduced by aesthetics, but how can anyone render the image of death agreeable
” The waxworks harnessed aesthetics to reach a larger audience
 “The popular part is really important, and I think that part really baffles people,” says Ebenstein
 “They assume the Venus was made for doctors – but it wasn’t, and in that way it wasn’t made for an audience of men the way some feminists expect it to be – it was made for men, women and children, that’s really essential to understanding it
” This 1746 mezzotint of a fashionably coiffed anatomised woman, L’Ange Anatomique (The Flayed Angel), was created by Arnaud-Éloi’s father Jacques-Fabien Gautier d’Agoty

Sleeping beautyHowever uncanny they might seem to us, the wax figures were primarily teaching tools
 According to Ebenstein, “Each pristine wax model at the museum was the product of the careful study of cadavers that were delivered from the nearby Santa Maria Nuova hospital
” They remain close to life
 “Over 200 years after their creation, La Specola’s waxworks are still considered remarkably accurate, some of them demonstrating anatomical structures that had yet to be named or described at the time of their making
” Yet in making them more attractive than a cadaver, the waxwork sculptors were also creating art works
 As Ebenstein argues, the anatomical Venus evoked “a long history of paintings and sculptures of placid, idealised nudes”
 And that’s where the human detail that unnerves us came in
 “She is designed to charm in every detail: her glistening glass eyes are rimmed with real eye-lashes, her bared throat is bound by a string of pearls, and she boasts a lustrous cascade of human hair
” This figure is known as ‘the Sleeping Beauty’: a 1925 replica of the original piece from 1767, it’s a breathing wax model by Swiss physician and master wax sculptor Philippe Curtius

The anatomy and the ecstasy (Credit: Credit: Alamy)
The anatomy and the ecstasyYet for Ebenstein, the anatomical Venus was not a figure that had been sexualised
 “Some feminists have a kneejerk response to looking at this – I would argue that any fetish element didn’t exist at the time
” Instead, she argues, the figures tapped into a tradition of religious sculpture
 “Susini, who made the most famous of the Venuses, also made waxes of a dying Christ that were beautiful
” When we interpret the Venus in this way, she believes, we’re revealing our own cultural biases
 “That expression on her face that we read as erotic today, I do not believe it was seen that way at the time – because otherwise it wouldn’t be on every saint in the church,” she says
 “Something has changed in us; we can’t see anything without reading a prurient intent into it
 I really don’t believe that’s how they were understood at the time
” In the book, Ebenstein picks out a sculpture of Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s life-sized white marble masterpiece, the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa (1647–52) at Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome (pictured)
 “It is likely that a different understanding of the ecstatic than our own influenced Venus’s reception,” she writes
 “The ecstatic was understood at that time not merely as a profane, sensual experience, but as an expression of the sacred: a mystical experience

A question of faith (Credit: Credit: Josephinum, Collections and History of Medicine, MedUni Vienna/Photo Joanna Ebenstein)
A question of faith“What it draws on, the language it draws on, is so much broader than you would think, and that helps to make sense of it,” claims Ebenstein
 Attempting to unpick specific influences can be a thankless task
 “There are all these strange overlaps between Catholicism and medicine, in this desire to preserve and effigise the body
 Because the body has all of this meaning: in medicine, it has meaning because it tells us about the world, and in religion it has meaning because it’s a healing tool
 It’s a very complicated terrain which is difficult to untangle
” The Venus appears at a time when the two are beginning to unspool
 “You have these two different philosophies, science and medicine versus religion, that are attempting to tell us the answers about where we fit in the universe, what life is for, what consciousness is, what the body is, and how we deal with death and disease
 Venus is a moment when it’s in both hands: the torch is being passed from one to the other
” (Credit: Josephinum, Collections and History of Medicine, MedUni Vienna/Photo Joanna Ebenstein)
Hidden beliefs (Credit: Credit: Münchner Stadtmuseum, Sammlumg Puppentheater/Schaustellerei, Munich)
Hidden beliefsYet it was to be a long time before the torch had been passed
 “I think this particular way of looking at the world lingered on longer than we think, and you can see that by looking at old medical atlases,” says Ebenstein
 “Up until the early 19th Century, you still see memento mori imagery in books that were ostensibly about bones, or childbirth
 To me, that suggests these ideas are still in circulation – whether scientists believed them, or felt they had to include them just because it’s the way people need it explained in order to understand, I don’t know
” At that time, she argues, medical imagery as we now understand it was not just a diagrammatic understanding
 “It was also about man’s place in nature, about the nature of life and death, and about God
 I feel that this idea we have now about ‘proper’ anatomical imagery, which should be devoid of extraneous detail, it shouldn’t have beautiful hair or a beautiful face – it should be as neutral and diagrammatic as possible – didn’t really come into being until Gray’s Anatomy in 1858
 That changed how we start thinking about the correct ways to depict the dead body – it shifted in a big way
” Our own ‘objective’ scientific viewpoint remains as filtered as the beliefs of the 18th-Century Florentines
 “I think we’re still within that world
 That’s now our style, and it looks invisible to us, but I expect in 100 years’ time people will look at it and think that it says something culturally about who we are now
” This dissectable Venus was created by the workshop of Rudolph Pohl, Dresden, Germany, circa 1930

Bodily function (Credit: Credit: Université de Montpellier anatomical collection/Photo Marc Dantan/Courtesy of Thames & Hudson Ltd)
Bodily functionBy overcoming our initial reactions to figures like the Spitzner Anatomical Venus (shown here in a different stage of dissection), Ebenstein believes we can learn more about our own hidden cultural beliefs
 “The Venus has many interpretations – some people find her deeply offensive or horrible – but there are ways to have a more nuanced understanding
 I would be pleased if people came away saying ‘oh I thought this was disgusting, but now I understand that my feeling of disgust is more about who we are today than about the intention of the makers at the time
’” And the Venus embodies an approach that Ebenstein thinks we could benefit from now: “a multi-disciplinary attitude, in which aesthetics and artistic expression and truth in a scientific way could all work together to draw in and engage an audience, and make them want to learn”
 Because, as she says, “we all have bodies, and we all think about them and we’re all afraid of them and intrigued by them”

 “Actually,” he says, “Vermeer isn’t an original artist
 Most of his ideas, his compositions, even his tricks, come from other painters
” He shrugs
 “Still, he dwarfs them all
” 
To many people, for whom Vermeer is a byword for artistic perfection, a statement about his lack of originality will sound startling
 But, then, the Louvre’s revelatory blockbuster, Vermeer and the Masters of Genre Painting, which will travel later this year to both the National Gallery of Ireland and Washington’s National Gallery of Art, is attempting to overturn some of the oldest and most steadfast ideas about the 17th Century Dutch master
 “Overturning those ideas
” Ducos asks, rhetorically
 “Killing them, you could say
”
View of Delft 
Delft is the city where father of the nation William the Silent was assassinated and where the monarchs of the House of Orange-Nassau are interred to this day (Credit: Wikipedia)
Chief among them is the notion that Vermeer was a genius who worked in splendid isolation
 This stems from the famous description of Vermeer by Théophile Thoré-Bürger, the 19th Century French art historian who rediscovered him, as the “Sphinx of Delft”
 (Thoré was referring to the Dutch city where Vermeer was baptised in 1632 and buried in 1675
) “It is a very alluring phrase,” Ducos says, “because it suggests the mystery, the enigma, the sheer beauty of it all – but also the provincialism: Delft, in Thoré’s phrase, is imagined as a remote town
Yet, Ducos reminds me, in Vermeer’s day, Delft was anything but a backwater
 “In the 17th Century, it was abuzz,” he explains
 “You had Amsterdam, the great metropolis, The Hague, Rotterdam – and Delft, which had an aristocratic atmosphere
” In such a cosmopolitan climate, Ducos continues, it is inconceivable that Vermeer was unaware of developments in Dutch art happening elsewhere
Unreal life
This is the premise of the show at the Louvre, which is also celebrating Dutch Golden Age art upstairs, in the Sully Wing (where another exhibition showcases 17th Century Dutch masterpieces, including 11 works by Rembrandt, from the Leiden Collection in New York): that Vermeer, like his contemporaries, was enmeshed in the art world of his own time, and had regular access to pictures by his peers, many of which inspired his own work
The Milkmaid

Another common misconception about Vermeer – that he meticulously chronicled daily life – is the result of a wider misunderstanding about the nature of Dutch genre scenes
 Traditionally, genre painting is understood as the art of the everyday – and it’s something, the textbooks tells us, at which Dutch Golden Age painters excelled
The verisimilitude of these paintings is high, but the realism is low – Blaise Ducos
At the Louvre, for instance, we find almost 80 elegant Dutch genre scenes, mostly depicting fashionable young gentlemen and society women engaged in various pastimes and leisurely pursuits, from playing musical instruments and writing letters, to adjusting strings of pearls and receiving well-heeled visitors
 Artists of the Dutch Golden Age were known for their consummate technical skill, which they wielded to capture flawlessly the appearance of the world
 As a result, many of the paintings at the Louvre – by the likes of Gerard ter Borch, Gerrit Dou, and Frans van Mieris – seem almost photographically realistic
 They are like snapshots, apparently recording the customs of well-to-do people in the Dutch Republic
Not so, says Ducos
 “The verisimilitude of these paintings is high, but the realism is low,” he says
 “They are not like photographs
 Rather, they are scenes that are arranged and rearranged, and that’s not realistic
 For example, they are not portraits but paintings of ideal types: women of beauty, scholars
 Some objects, such as chandeliers, were never found in [domestic] interiors at that time
” He pauses
 “These paintings were done for the rich, and they were trying to show off
”
The exhibition at the Louvre makes plain this paradoxical point about the unrealistic nature of Dutch realism
 Looking at a Dutch genre painting on its own, it’s tempting to assume that the artist was carefully transcribing whatever was before him
 Seeing so many genre paintings together, we realise that Dutch artists weren’t interested only in reality: they were also keeping one eye firmly on other artworks by friends and rivals

Consider the juxtaposition that kick-starts the show: Pieter de Hooch’s Woman Weighing Gold Coin and Vermeer’s Woman with a Balance (both c1664)
 Yes, each painting differs in style and atmosphere, but, compositionally, they are remarkably similar – so much so, in fact, that one surely inspired the other
 In this case, the catalogue suggests, Vermeer most probably followed and improved upon De Hooch
Elsewhere, we find groups of paintings that are demonstrably in dialogue with one another: pictures of women at their toilet, of women interacting with parrots, of women writing love letters, of women playing guitars
 Dutch genre scenes often present attractive young women, resplendent in shimmering satin, for the delectation of the viewer

In one trio of seductive paintings, three young women sit by themselves at keyboards, looking out coyly at the viewer
 The earliest in the series is Dou’s Woman at the Clavichord (c1665), from London’s Dulwich Picture Gallery
 In the catalogue, art historian Marjorie E Wieseman suggests that Vermeer “probably” saw it in 1665, in an exhibition of 27 paintings by Dou that belonged to a collector in Leiden
 Either way, Vermeer obviously borrowed and adapted Dou’s composition at least twice: once, in the National Gallery’s Young Woman Seated at a Virginal (c1671-74), and again, this time streamlined and intensified, in the Leiden Collection’s Woman Seated at a Virginal (also c1671-74) – the only one of Vermeer’s 36 extant paintings still in private hands
Cut and paste
There are even examples in the Louvre’s exhibition, says Ducos, of an artist taking a specific motif from another artist’s painting in what we would call “a cut-and-paste job”
 Sadly, there are no sketches or preparatory drawings to “prove” this: “We do not have that,” Ducos says, “and not because they have not survived; we would have some traces of that
” Rather, Ducos suggests, Dutch artists in the third quarter of the 17th Century were constantly on the move, and would have encountered paintings on their travels
“Take Vermeer,” says Ducos
 “We have no account of him travelling – but the transportation system was the best in Europe at the time
 He must have seen paintings in artists’ workshops or, more likely, in collectors’ mansions in Delft, near Delft, in The Hague, which was so close, or even in Amsterdam
” 
Why is Vermeer a household name but Ter Borcht isn’t
"Collectors’ mansions were the place for people to meet – the hub of their time – and Dutchmen are very social,” he adds
 “Our exhibition shows that these artists had strong relationships and were vying against each other, spurred by many possible emotions: admiration, jealousy, the wish of one to outdo the other
 Everyone in this group of genre painters was looking at each other
”

It’s a compelling case, backed up by the evidence of the paintings
 But isn’t there a risk that by situating Vermeer firmly in the context of his contemporaries, his genius will be diminished
 After all, time and again, the Louvre’s exhibition demonstrates that the great innovator within Dutch genre painting was Ter Borch, who, in his day, was far more famous than Vermeer
 So how come Vermeer, not Ter Borch, is now a household name
Ducos thinks for a moment
 “Vermeer has such a distinct tone,” he replies, “and a psychology that is absent from the other paintings
 Most Dutch genre paintings are functional: they describe
 The art of describing – that’s very Dutch
 Vermeer is Dutch, of course
 But, at the same time, he’s universal
 In a way, he’s like a Chinese man wandering in Europe: he could be from anywhere, which isn’t the case with Ter Borch, who has a much more local flavour
”
Ducos gestures towards The Milkmaid, which Vermeer painted when he was only about 25 years old
 “The Louvre has the source for this painting,” he says, referring to Dou’s Kitchen Maid of c1645-53, a tour de force of detailed realism, which also depicts a female servant pouring liquid into a bowl – in this case positioned beside a bunch of suggestive carrots
“Obviously, the two compositions are much alike,” Ducos continues
 “But I think Vermeer was unnerved by what Dou had done, because he thought it was anecdotal, even a bit ludicrous
 So, he reacted against Dou’s painting and simplified it, peeled away all the accessories, all the unnecessary impedimenta
 In the Dou, the face of the lady and the carrots are given the same importance
 But in The Milkmaid, there is hierarchy, and everything is meaningful
”
How, then, would Ducos describe the nature of Vermeer’s genius
 “Vermeer’s art is an art of transformation,” he replies
 “In The Milkmaid, he transformed Dou, by getting back to the essential, and turning a humble servant into a queen
 Once you’ve deciphered Dou’s Kitchen Maid, it’s done
 With Vermeer, there is more psychological complexity, more to dwell on
 You can spend your life looking at The Milkmaid
”Milton’s Paradise Lost is rarely read today
 But this epic poem, 350 years old this month, remains a work of unparalleled imaginative genius that shapes English literature even now
In more than 10,000 lines of blank verse, it tells the story of the war for heaven and of man’s expulsion from Eden
 Its dozen sections are an ambitious attempt to comprehend the loss of paradise – from the perspectives of the fallen angel Satan and of man, fallen from grace
 Even to readers in a secular age, the poem is a powerful meditation on rebellion, longing and the desire for redemption
Despite being born into prosperity, Milton’s worldview was forged by personal and political struggle
 A committed republican, he rose to public prominence in the ferment of England’s bloody civil war: two months after the execution of King Charles I in 1649, Milton became a diplomat for the new republic, with the title of Secretary for Foreign Tongues
 (He wrote poetry in English, Greek, Latin and Italian, prose in Dutch, German, French and Spanish, and read Hebrew, Aramaic and Syriac)

Milton gained a reputation in Europe for his erudition and rhetorical prowess in defence of England’s radical new regime; at home he came to be regarded as a prolific advocate for the Commonwealth cause
 But his deteriorating eyesight limited his diplomatic travels
 By 1654, Milton was completely blind
 For the final 20 years of his life, he would dictate his poetry, letters and polemical tracts to a series of amanuenses – his daughters, friends and fellow poets

In Paradise Lost, Milton draws on the classical Greek tradition to conjure the spirits of blind prophets
 He invokes Homer, author of the first great epics in Western literature, and Tiresias, the oracle of Thebes who sees in his mind’s eye what the physical eye cannot
 As the philosopher Descartes wrote during Milton’s lifetime, “it is the soul which sees, and not the eye”
 William Blake, the most brilliant interpreter of Milton, later wrote of how “the Eye of Imagination” saw beyond the narrow confines of “Single vision”, creating works that outlasted “mortal vegetated Eyes”
Clever devil
When Milton began Paradise Lost in 1658, he was in mourning
 It was a year of public and private grief, marked by the deaths of his second wife, memorialised in his beautiful Sonnet 23, and of England’s Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, which precipitated the gradual disintegration of the republic
 Paradise Lost is an attempt to make sense of a fallen world: to “justify the ways of God to men”, and no doubt to Milton himself
Milton’s religious lexicon – which sought to explain a ‘fallen’ world – itself has fallen from use
But these biographical aspects should not downplay the centrality of theology to the poem
 As the critic Christopher Ricks wrote of Paradise Lost, “Art for art’s sake
 Art for God’s sake”
 One reason why Milton is read less now is that his religious lexicon – which sought to explain a ‘fallen’ world – itself has fallen from use
 Milton the Puritan spent his life engaged in theological disputation on subjects as diverse as toleration, divorce and salvation

The poem begins with Satan, the “Traitor Angel”, cast into hell after rebelling against his creator, God
 Refusing to submit to what he calls “the Tyranny of Heaven”, Satan seeks revenge by tempting into sin God’s precious creation: man
 Milton gives a vivid account of “Man’s First Disobedience” before offering a guide to salvation
Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven – Milton
Ricks notes that Paradise Lost is “a fierce argument about God’s justice” and that Milton’s God has been deemed inflexible and cruel
 By contrast, Satan has a dark charisma (“he pleased the ear”) and a revolutionary demand for self-determination
 His speech is peppered with the language of democratic governance (“free choice”, “full consent”, “the popular vote”) – and he famously declares, “Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven”
 Satan rejects God’s “splendid vassalage”, seeking to live:
Free, and to none accountable, preferring
Hard liberty before the easy yoke
Of servile Pomp
Nonconformist, anti-establishment writers such as Percy Shelley found a kindred spirit in this depiction of Satan (“Milton’s Devil as a moral being is… far superior to his God”, he wrote)
 Famously, William Blake, who contested the very idea of the Fall, remarked that “The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of Angels & God, and at liberty when of Devils & Hell, is because he was a true Poet and of the Devil’s party without knowing it”
Milton was a true Poet and of the Devil’s party without knowing it – William Blake
Like Cromwell, Milton believed his mission was to usher in the kingdom of God on earth
 While he loathed the concept of the ‘divine right of kings’, Milton was willing to submit himself to God in the belief, in Benjamin Franklin's words, that “Rebellion to Tyrants Is Obedience to God”

Although discussion of Paradise Lost often is dominated by political and theological arguments, the poem also contains a tender celebration of love
 In Milton’s version, Eve surrenders to temptation in part to be closer to Adam, “the more to draw his love”
 She wishes for the freedom to err (“What is faith, love, virtue unassayed
”)
 When she does succumb, Adam chooses to join her: “to lose thee were to lose myself”, he says:
How can I live without you, how forgo
Thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined,
To live again in these wild woods forlorn
Should God create another Eve, and I
Another rib afford, yet loss of thee
Would never from my heart
Canon fodder
When Paradise Lost was published in London in 1667, Milton had fallen out of favour
 Just months before the restoration of the Stuart monarchy in May 1660, he had published a pamphlet denouncing kingship
 Now Milton was scorned, his writings were burned, and he was imprisoned in the Tower of London – only narrowly escaping execution after the intercession of a fellow poet, Andrew Marvell
Yet Paradise Lost gained immediate acclaim even among royalists
 The poet laureate John Dryden reworked Milton’s epic, casting Cromwell – a regicide with dictatorial tendencies – in the role of Satan
 Samuel Johnson ranked Paradise Lost among the highest “productions of the human mind”
Milton’s style was suggestive and free from what he called ‘the troublesome and modern bondage of rhyming’
Romantic writers celebrated Milton both for his stance against censorship (“Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience”, Milton wrote in the pamphlet Areopagitica), and for his innovative poetic form, which was suggestive, allusive and free from what he called “the troublesome and modern bondage of rhyming”
 Paradise Lost inspired Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, while Wordsworth began his famous sonnet London, 1802 with a plea: “Milton
 thou shouldst be living at this hour: England hath need of thee”
But not all critics were so favourable
 The 20th Century brought us the ‘Milton Controversy’, during which his legacy was fiercely contested
 His detractors included poets TS Eliot and Ezra Pound (who wrote that “Milton is the worst sort of poison”), while support came from both devout Christians (like CS Lewis) and atheists (including William Empson, for whom “The reason why the poem is so good is that it makes God so bad”)
 Malcolm X read Paradise Lost in prison, sympathising with Satan, while AE Housman quipped that “malt does more than Milton can / To reconcile God’s ways to man”
No one, not even Shakespeare, surpasses Milton in his command of the sound, the music, the weight and taste and texture of English words – Philip Pullman
In recent years, Paradise Lost has found new admirers
 Milton is “our greatest public poet”, says author Philip Pullman, whose acclaimed trilogy His Dark Materials was inspired by the poem (and takes its title from Book II, line 916)
 Pullman loves Milton’s audacity –his declaration that he will create “Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhyme” – and his musicality: “No one, not even Shakespeare, surpasses Milton in his command of the sound, the music, the weight and taste and texture of English words”
 Pullman has declared: “I am of the Devil’s party and know it”
Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials

Milton’s enemies regarded his blindness as divine retribution, but his condition enhanced his acute musical sensibility
 Pullman is enchanted by the poem’s “incantatory quality”, and implores readers to experience it aurally: “Rolling swells and peels of sound, powerful rhythms and rich harmonies… that very form casts a spell”
 Paradise Lost makes an excellent audio book
It is said that Milton had fevered dreams during the writing of Paradise Lost and would wake with whole passages formulated in his mind
 The first time I read the poem, I did so in a single sitting, overnight – like Jacob wrestling with the Angel until morning
 Each re-reading brings intoxication, exhilaration and exhaustion, and vindicates Milton’s observation: “The mind is its own place, and in itself / Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven
